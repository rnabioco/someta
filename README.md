Cell-type annotations are frequently excluded from public single cell
datasets. This hinders single cell sequencing analysis reproducibility
and accessibility. To better describe the issue, we monitor GEO entries
monthly (currently set to auto-update at 1AM UTC, 20th of the month),
and programmatically determine the fraction of entries with
(potentially) usable cell metadata.

As of the initial presentation of this issue (10–17–2020), the number is
a frustratingly low **0.122**.

Please find the latest numbers below, or at [full report
page](https://rnabioco.github.io/scmetadata/articles/get_geo.html).

Current fraction with metadata: **0.1253333**.

Number of depositions with updated metadata records since description of
the issue here: **0**.
