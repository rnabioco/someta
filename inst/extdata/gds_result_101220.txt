(Submitter supplied) While the majority of cells contain a single nucleus, cell types such as trophoblasts, osteoclasts, and skeletal myofibers require multinucleation. One advantage of multinucleation can be the assignment of distinct functions to different nuclei, but comprehensive interrogation of transcriptional heterogeneity within multinucleated tissues has been challenging due to the presence of a shared cytoplasm. more...

(Submitter supplied) By utilizing single-cell analysis at different times after P2 injury(0, 3, and 5 dpi), we discovered that neonatal microglia undergo a transient activation and play at least two critical roles in scar-free healing. First, they transiently secrete fibronectin and its binding proteins, to form extracellular matrix bridges that ligate the severed ends. Second, neonatal, but not adult, microglia express a number of extracellular and intracellular peptidase inhibitors, along with other molecules involved in inflammatory resolution.

(Submitter supplied) Human chronic infectious diseases, including malaria and HIV and autoimmune diseases, notably SLE, are accompanied by a striking expansion of a subpopulation of B cells termed atypical memory B cells (MBCs). We compared the single cell transcriptional profiles of B cells in malaria and HIV, characterizing and uncovering heterogeneity within each B cell subset. Remarkably, atypical MBC clusters in these two diseases showed significant similarities to each other as well as to atypical MBCs in autoimmune diseases, suggesting a common driver of their expansion and shared functions. more...

(Submitter supplied) Single nucleus RNA-Seq (snRNA-Seq) is used as an alternative to single cell RNA-Seq, as it allows transcriptomic profiling of frozen tissue. However, it is unclear whether snRNA-Seq is able to detect cellular state in human tissue. Indeed, snRNA-Seq analyses of human brain samples have failed to detect a consistent microglial activation signature in Alzheimer’s Disease. Our comparison of microglia from single cells and single nuclei of four human subjects revealed that, while the majority of genes showed similar relative abundances in cells and nuclei, a small population of genes (~1%) was depleted in nuclei compared to whole cells. more...

86. Identification of human endogenous retroviruses working as enhancers in cancer cells
(Submitter supplied) Human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) are a sort of transposable elements. HERVs harbor abundant regulatory elements in their sequences and have a potential to work as enhancers modulating the expressions of the adjacent genes. Some HERV-enhancers are particularly activated in cancer cells and suspected to be associated with cancer progression. To verify the enhancer activity of HERVs on the gene expressions in lung adenocarcinoma cells, we established the HERV-excised A549 cell lines using a CRISPR-Cas9 system and performed RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis of these cells.

164. Single cell RNA seq of hepatic and renal p16 positive cells
(Submitter supplied) We performed the single cell RNA sequencing of mouse normal kidney, normal liver, and NASH-induced liver from p16-tdTomato mice. In order to enrich p16 positive cells, we independently sorted the non-separated cells (including both of p16 positive and negative cells) and p16 positive cells alone through tdTomato intensity by FACS. By obtaining 13,876 single cell transcripts, after the graph-based clustering and marker genes defined cell type classification, we identified the heterogeneity of in vivo p16-positive cells which dispersedly existed in renal cells and non-parenchymal hepatic cells. more...

166. Sirt2 Inhibition Reprograms T Cell Metabolism to Confer Superior Anti-Tumor Immunity
(Submitter supplied) Metabolism is a key driver of T cell functions, and the switch from oxidative-phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis is a hallmark of T cell activation. However, the mechanisms underlying the metabolic switch remain unclear. Here, we report that the Sirtuin-2 (Sirt2) deacetylase protein functions as a metabolic checkpoint that harnesses T cell effector functions and impairs anti-tumor immunity. Specifically, upregulation of Sirt2 expression in human tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes (TILs) negatively correlates with response to Nivolumab and TIL therapy in non-small cell lung cancer. more...

(Submitter supplied) The enzyme transport vehicle (ETV:IDS) is a lysosomal enzyme fused to iduronate 2-sulfatase (ETV:IDS), the lysosomal enzyme deficient in mucopolysaccharidosis type II (MPS II). ETV:IDS treatment significantly improved brain delivery of IDS in a preclinical model of disease, enabling enhanced distribution to neurons, astrocytes, and microglia throughout the brain. Improved brain exposure for ETV:IDS translated to a significant reduction in accumulated substrates in these CNS cell types and peripheral tissues, and in a complete correction of downstream disease-relevant pathologies in the brain, including secondary accumulation of lysosomal lipids, perturbed gene expression, neuroinflammation, and neuronal injury. more...

(Submitter supplied) We developed a novel FACS-based method to isolate enriched populations of neurons, astrocytes, and microglia. Whole mouse brains were digested, and populations of neurons, astrocytes, and microglia were subsequently enriched by FACS using a combination of positive gating on cell-type specific markers and stringent negative selection against markers of oligodendrocytes and endothelial cells. We confirmed a strong enrichment of corresponding cell-type specific genes in isolated populations and a reduction in gene markers of endothelial cells and oligodendrocytes, demonstrating that highly pure populations of neurons, astrocytes, and microglia were obtained.

(Submitter supplied) Severe infections are a major stress on haematopoiesis, where the consequences for haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) have only recently started to emerge. HSC function critically depends on the integrity of complex bone marrow (BM) niches, however whether the BM microenvironment plays a role in mediating the effects of infection on HSCs remains an open question. Here, using a murine model of malaria and combining single cell RNA sequencing, mathematical modelling, transplantation assays and intravital microscopy, we show that haematopoiesis is reprogrammed upon infection, whereby the HSC compartment turns over significantly faster than in steady-state and HSC function is drastically affected as a result. more...

198. Early emergence of T central memory precursors programs clonal dominance during chronic viral infection [bulkRNAseq]
(Submitter supplied) Chronic infection with cytomegalovirus (CMV) leads to long-term maintenance of extraordinarily large CMV-specific T cell populations. The magnitude of this so-called ‘memory inflation’ is thought to be mainly determined by the availability of antigenic stimuli during the chronic phase of infection. However, by mapping the long-term development of CD8+ T cell families derived from single naive precursors, we find that T cell fate decisions, taken during the acute phase of murine CMV infection, can alter the level of memory inflation by more than 1000-fold. more...

199. Next generation sequencing of CD11b+ cells from female and male Wildtype and Cystatin C knockout mice with experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE)
(Submitter supplied) Rationale: Towards clarifying the role of the cysteine protease inhibitor, Cystatin C (CysC), whose expression is augmented in the brains of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and C57BL/6J mice with experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE - a model of MS), we discovered that CysC plays a detrimental function in MOG35-55-induced EAE, but only in female animals. Female CysC null mice displayed significantly lower clinical signs of disease compared to wildtype (WT) littermates that was associated with reduced interleukin-6 production and lower expression of key proteins (CD80, CD86, MHC II, LC3A/B) involved in antigen processing, presentation and co-stimulation in antigen presenting cells (APCs), specifically CD11b+ cells. more...

The scRNA-seq profiling data showed that five different subtypes of stromal fibroblasts existed in mouse mammary glands. HFD-induced obesity led to upregulated expression of extracellular matrix (ECM) genes (Col3a1, Col6a3, Eln, and Sparc) and downregulated expression of immunoregulatory genes (Iigp1, Ccl2, and Cxcl10) in these stromal subtype cells. more...

231. Signals controlling maintenance and differentiation of embryonic gastric epithelial progenitors
(Submitter supplied) A dozen of cells expressing various marker genes was defined as adult gastric epithelial stem cells. Do these cells represent different cell types or they are just the same cell with cycling expression of different marker genes? The origin of the adult stem cells could answer this question. Yet, the identity of the embryonic gastric progenitors was not known. We performed single cell RNA-sequencing to characterize cellular composition of the embryonic stomach at the time of initiation of cytodifferentiation. more...

236. Spatiotemporal single-cell profiling of gastrointestinal GVHD reveals invasive and tissue-resident memory T cell states
(Submitter supplied) One of the major barriers to understanding the control of T cell infiltration into target tissues has been the inherent difficulty in capturing the key variable of time in this process. Time is a critical variable, given that T cells are actively homing towards and infiltrating into target organs, and are concordantly evolving a highly pathogenic transcriptional program. Without understanding the time-dependency of T cell infiltration, we cannot fully comprehend key drivers and their dynamics. more...

Here, we use single-cell RNA and TCR sequencing of healthy cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and single-nucleus RNA sequencing of brain parenchyma to profile the T cell state in the human central nervous system (CNS). We observe a continuum of T cell states, reflecting a blood-CSF “axis”, that we use to reveal that T cells in the CSF largely exhibit a tissue-resident phenotype with a balance of co-inhibitory and effector function gene expression, including PD-1+ T cells retaining the ability to produce IFNg. more...

(Submitter supplied) Central nervous system B cells have several potential roles in multiple sclerosis (MS): secretors of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, presenters of autoantigens to T cells, producers of pathogenic antibodies, and reservoirs for viruses that trigger demyelination. To interrogate these roles, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) was performed on paired cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood from subjects with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS; n = 12), other neurologic diseases (ONDs; n = 1), and healthy controls (HCs; n = 3). more...

263. Single cell resolution regulatory landscape of the mouse kidney highlights cellular differentiation programs and renal disease targets
(Submitter supplied) Determining the epigenetic program that generates unique cell types in the kidney is critical for understanding cell-type heterogeneity during tissue homeostasis and injury response. Here, we profiled open chromatin and gene expression in developing and adult mouse kidneys at single cell resolution. We show critical reliance of gene expression on distal regulatory elements (enhancers). We define key cell type-specific transcription factors and major gene-regulatory circuits for kidney cells. more...

(Submitter supplied) The 5' end of eukaryotic mRNAs is protected by the m7G-cap structure. The transcription start site nucleotide is ribose methylated (Nm) in many eukaryotes, while an adenosine at this position is further methylated at the N6 position (m6A) by the mammalian Phosphorylated CTD-interacting Factor 1 (PCIF1) to generate m6Am. Here we show that while loss of cap-specific m6Am in mice does not affect viability or fertility, the Pcif1 mutants display reduced body-weight. more...

277. Selective silencing rather than targeted activation of gene expression underlies fate choice in human hematopoietic stem cells (scRNA-seq)
(Submitter supplied) When human cord blood derived CD34+ cells are induced to differentiate in vitro, they undergo rapid and dynamic morphological and molecular transformation that are critical for the fate commitment. Using ATAC-seq and single-cell RNA sequencing we detected two phases of this process. We show that a rapid and widespread chromatin opening - that makes most of the gene promoters in the genome accessible - precedes the high and unrestrained transcription of a large variety of genes. more...

279. A single cell atlas of the human proximal epididymis reveals cell-type specific functions and distinct roles for CFTR
(Submitter supplied) Spermatozoa released from the testis are unable to fertilize an egg without a coordinated process of maturation in the lumen of the epididymis.  Relatively little is known about the molecular events that integrate this critical progression along the male genital ducts in man. Here we use single cell RNA-sequencing to construct an atlas of the human proximal epididymis. We find that the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), which is pivotal in normal epididymis fluid transport, is most abundant in surface epithelial cells in the efferent ducts and in rare clear cells in the caput epididymis, suggesting region-specific functional properties. more...

294. Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Uncovers Heterogenous Transcriptional Signatures in Macrophages during Efferocytosis
(Submitter supplied) Efferocytosis triggers cellular reprogramming, including the induction of mRNA transcripts which encode anti-inflammatory cytokines that promote inflammation resolution. Our current understanding of this transcriptional response is largely informed from analysis of bulk phagocyte populations; however, this precludes the resolution of heterogeneity between individual macrophages and macrophage subsets. more...

295. SEAM: a spatial single nuclear metabolomics method for dissecting tissue microenvironment
(Submitter supplied) We report a method for analyzing spatial metabolomics at single cell level. In human fibrotic liver samples, we identified a novel hepatocyte subpopulation via SEAM and spatial transcriptomics using modified protocol of Geo-sea. For Geo-seq, we generated cDNA libraries from Hepa69-high (Proximal), Hepa69-low (Distal) and Fibrotic (FB) regions. The differential gene expression analysis between Hepa69-high and Hepa69-low indicates that genes from solute carrier transporter families were elevated in Hepa69-high group.

296. Circulation of gut pre-activated naïve CD8+ T cells enhances anti-tumor immunity in B cell defective mice
(Submitter supplied) The gut microbiome has garnered attention as an effective target to boost immunity and improve cancer immunotherapy. We found that B cell defective (BCD) mice, such as µ membrane tail deletion (µMT), have elevated anti-tumor immunity under specific-pathogen-free condition, depending on CD8+ T cells. Further studies suggest that microbiota-dependent upregulation of type-I IFN inducible genes, including Sca-1, in CD8+ T cells underlies the strong anti-tumor response of BCD mice. more...

(Submitter supplied) Piezo1 is a mechanosensitive ion channel that has gained recognition for its role in regulating diverse physiological processes. However, the influence of Piezo1 in inflammatory disease, including infection and tumor-immunity, is not well-studied. We postulated that Piezo1 links physical forces to immune regulation in myeloid cells. We discovered signal transduction via Piezo1 in myeloid cells and established this channel as the primary sensor of mechanical stress in these cells. more...

299. Single cell profiling of cerebral immune cells in the Interleukin-33 (IL-33) driven tumor microenvironment
(Submitter supplied) IL33 is a dual function cytokine which acts as a major orchestrator of the brain tumor microenvironment that contributes to tumorigenesis. We found that IL33 is expressed in a large subset of human glioma patient specimens and murine glioma models and that its expression is directly associated with the increased presence of tumor associated macrophages/monocytes/microglia. We analyzed the differences in the IL-33+ and IL-33- innate immune microenvironments at a single cell resolution and found substantial differences in the immune populations present and gene expression changes which may contribute to the increased tumoirgenicity of IL-33+ tumors.

Both cold- and iAdFASNKO-induced iWAT “browning” pathways upregulate the sympathetic nerve fiber (SNF) modulator Nrg4 and activate SNFs adjacent to beige adipocytes. Adipocyte cAMP/protein kinase A signaling is necessary for beige adipocyte appearance, as we show here it is blocked in Gsa deficient cold exposed or iAdFASNKO mice. more...

326. Dynamic changes in RNA-chromatin interactome promote endothelial dysfunction (scRNA-seq)
(Submitter supplied) Chromatin-associated RNA has been proposed as a type of epigenomic modification. Here, we test whether environmental stress can induce cellular dysfunction through modulating RNA-chromatin interactions. We induce endothelial cell (EC) dysfunction with high-glucose and TNF? (H+T), that mimic the common stress in diabetes mellitus. We characterize the H+T induced changes of single-cell RNA expression by scRNA-seq, DNA interactions by Hi-C, and RNA-chromatin interactions by iMARGI. more...

327. The Polycomb-Associated Factor Phf19 Controls Hematopoietic Stem Cell Status and Differentiation
(Submitter supplied) Adult hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are rare, multipotent cells in bone marrow that are responsible for generating all blood cell types. HSCs are a heterogeneous group of cells with high plasticity, in part conferred by epigenetic mechanisms. PHF19, a subunit of the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), is preferentially expressed in mouse hematopoietic precursors. Here, we show that genetic deletion of Phf19 increases HSC specific status. more...

339. Paired Imaging and Sequencing of Protein-DNA Interactions in Single Human Cells Using microDamID
(Submitter supplied) Genome regulation depends on carefully programmed protein-DNA interactions that maintain or alter gene expression states, often by influencing chromatin organization. Most studies of these interactions to date have relied on bulk methods, which in many systems cannot capture the dynamic single-cell nature of these interactions as they modulate cell states. One method allowing for sensitive single-cell mapping of protein-DNA interactions is DNA adenine methyltransferase identification (DamID), which records a protein’s DNA-binding history by methylating adenine bases in its vicinity, then selectively amplifies and sequences these methylated regions. more...

366. Identification of ALPPL2 as a novel specific and functional surface marker for naïve pluripotency
(Submitter supplied) We report ALPPL2 as a prominently specific and functional surface marker for naïve pluripotency. By performing RNA-seq analysis of TJ-1# and iCRISPR nESCs and pESCs, APG+ cells at different time points during naïve reprogramming, we validate ALPPL2’s specificity for naïve pluripotent state at transcriptional level. Deep analysis of the transcriptome differences between Wild Type (WT), ALPPL2 knockdown (AKD) cells via RNA-seq, Wild Type (WT), ALPPL2 knockout (AKO) and IGFBP1 knockout (IKO) individual colonies in detail via Smart-seq, and performing RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) using IGF2BP1 antibody in nESCs followed by RNA-seq or qPCR analysis, we identify that ALPPL2 is essential for both establishment and maintenance of naïve pluripotency via interacting with IGF2BP1 to stabilize TFCP2L1 and STAT3 mRNA level.

(Submitter supplied) Alopecia areata (AA) is one of the most common autoimmune conditions, presenting initially with loss of hair without overt skin changes. The unremarkable appearance of the skin surface contrasts with the complex immune activity occurring at the hair follicle. AA pathogenesis is due to the loss of immune privilege of the hair follicle leading to autoimmune attack. Although the literature has focused on CD8+ T cells, vital roles for CD4+ T cells and antigen-presenting cells have been suggested. more...

(Submitter supplied) A measles virus (MeV) isolate bearing a single amino acid change in the fusion protein (F) -- L454W -- was identified in two patients who died of MeV central nervous system (CNS) infection. We analyzed whether this mutation confers an advantage over wild type virus in the CNS, thereby contributing to disease in these patients. Using murine ex vivo organotypic brain cultures and human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived brain organoids, we show that specific CNS adaptive mutations in F result in augmented spread of virus ex vivo and that this is associated with an enhanced innate immune response. more...

(Submitter supplied) Effector CD8+ T cell (TE) proliferation and cytokine production depends on enhanced glucose metabolism. However, circulating T cells continuously adapt to glucose fluctuations caused by diet and inter-organ metabolite exchange. Here we show that transient glucose restriction (TGR) in activated CD8+ TE metabolically primes effector functions and enhances tumour clearance in mice. Tumor-specific TGR CD8+ TE co-cultured with tumor spheroids in replete conditions display enhanced effector molecule expression, and adoptive transfer of these cells in a murine lymphoma model leads to greater numbers of immunologically functional circulating donor cells and complete tumor clearance. more...

393. Two subsets of stem-like CD8+ memory T cell progenitors with distinct fate commitments in humans
(Submitter supplied) T cell memory relies on the generation of antigen-specific progenitors with stem-like properties. However, the identity of these progenitors has remained unclear, precluding a full understanding of the differentiation trajectories that underpin the heterogeneity of memory and effector T cells. Here, we used a series of high-dimensional approaches guided by single-cell RNA sequencing data to map the organizational structure of the human CD8+ memory T cell pool under physiological conditions. more...

(Submitter supplied) The EGFR/Ras/ERK signalling pathway is a primary driver of cancer cell proliferation and metastasis in tumours that exhibit high cell-to-cell heterogeneity. While the signalling activity of this pathway is frequently amplified in tumours, it is not understood how the kinetic aspects of its activation in tumours differ from normal cellular signalling. We explored these single-cell kinetic differences using live-cell reporters of ERK signalling in the breast cancer progression series HMT-3522 and found that ERK activity in invasive cells is similar in amplitude to non-malignant cells but is highly dynamic and more disordered, leading to more heterogeneous expression of ERK target genes. more...

(Submitter supplied) Human γδ T cells take a small but important part in the immune system. Human γδ T cells are usually categorized by the V gene of their T cell receptor (TCR) δ chain; most of which are Vδ1+ or Vδ2+. Naive γδ T cells are often found from neonates and cytotoxic γδ T cells (γδCTLs) are frequent in adults. However, phenotypes and the developmental programs of human γδ T cells are not fully clear. Here, by single-cell RNA sequencing (sc-RNAseq) of transcriptome and T cell receptor (sc-TCRseq) on γδ T cells from neonates and adults, we revealed human γδ T cells can be divided as naïve T cells, γδCTLs, and γδNKT cells which are featured by pro-Vδ1, Vδ1, and Vδ2 TCR repertoire, respectively. more...

424. T cell regeneration from pluripotent stem cells by defined transcription factors Runx1 and Hoxa9 [single hematopoietic cells (iR9-iHEC&iR9-iHPC) II]
(Submitter supplied) We identified that the coordinated expression of exogenous Runx1 and Hoxa9 during the haematopoietic induction process from mouse PSC resulted in a type of induced hemogenic endothelial cells (iHEC). The single iHEC can be robustly educated into induced haematopoietic progenitor cells (iHPC), which gave rise to induced T cells (iT cells) with abundant TCRαβ repertoire in vivo. We  sorted  the  single iHEC and iHPC  from  day-14,  day-17,  day-21  cell  products  derived  from  241 iR9-ES  and  performed  single-cell  RNA-Seq.

(Submitter supplied) Ependymoma (EPN) is a brain tumor commonly presenting in childhood that remains fatal in the majority of children. Intra-tumoral cellular heterogeneity in bulk tumor samples significantly confounds our understanding of EPN biology, impeding development of effective therapy. We used single-cell RNA sequencing to identify four neoplastic cell subpopulations in posterior fossa EPN patient samples that underlie traditional subgroup classification and harbor divergent lineage trajectories and clinical outcomes. more...

(Submitter supplied) Mechanisms driving tumor progression from less aggressive subtypes to more aggressive states represent key targets for breast cancer therapy. We identified a subset of Luminal A primary breast tumors to give rise to HER2-enriched (HER2E) subtype metastases, but remain clinically HER2 negative (cHER2-). By testing the unique genetic and transcriptomic features of these cases, we developed the hypothesis that fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4) drives this subtype switching. more...

442. PHF7 Modulates BRDT Stability and Histone-to-Protamine Exchange during Spermiogenesis
(Submitter supplied) Spermatogenesis is a complex process of sperm generation, including mitosis, meiosis, and spermiogenesis. During spermiogenesis, histones in post-meiotic spermatids are removed from chromatin and replaced by protamines. Although histone-to-protamine exchange is important for sperm nuclear condensation, the underlying regulatory mechanism is still poorly understood. Here, we identify PHD finger protein 7 (PHF7) as an E3 ubiquitin ligase for histone H3K14 in post-meiotic spermatids. more...

Therefore, we sought to delineate CASK mutation consequences and neuronal level effects using induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons from two mutation carriers; one male diagnosed with ASD and a female with MICPCH. We show a reduction of the CASK protein in maturing neurons from the mutation carriers, which leads to significant downregulation of gene sets involved in presynaptic development and CASK protein interactors. more...

457. Extraction of Distinct Cell Types from within a Genetically Continuous Population
(Submitter supplied) The brain is composed of millions of diverse neurons that differ systematically in the genes that they express. Analyses of single cell gene expression data reveal clusters which correspond to different cell types that differ in their connectivity and function. Can the connections formed by genetically identical neurons systematically alter their gene expression? Here we address this question  by combining retrograde labeling, single cell gene expression, and rabies-based analyses of connectivity to assess cortical-cortical projection neurons in the mouse primary visual cortex. more...

(Submitter supplied) By characterizing the meningeal compartment of naive mice, here we explored a unique population of tissue-resident gd T cells, which we found to be the major source of IL-17A in the steady state meninges. gd T cells rapidly harbor meninges at perinatal stages and actively make IL-17A. Their IL-17A production was TCR-dependent but it occurred independent of commensal microbiota. The absence of meningeal gd T cells was related with risk-taking behavior in mice, which was dependent on the IL-17A signaling directly in the prefrontal cortex neurons. more...

(Submitter supplied) Single cells were isolated from the main scenarios during tumor dissemination of a highly metastatic Patient-Derived Xenograft model (Panc-265) in order to discover potential therapeutic targets against the metastatic settings of PDAC. Primary tumor (n=37), liver metastasis (n=23) cells and circulating tumor cells (CTCs, n=10, in bloodstream) were subjected of single-cell RNAseq. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis revealed that CTCs clustered separately from their matched primary and metastatic tumors and were characterized by low expression of ECM associated genes, high expression of cell cycle genes, a metabolic switch to oxidative phosphorylation and high expression of genes involved in ribosome biogenesis.

However, we have a very limited understanding of the identity, origin, and function of many cells that make up late stage atherosclerotic lesions, as well as the mechanisms by which they control plaque stability. Methods and Results Using RNAseq and ChIPseq of advanced atherosclerotic lesions from mice, we provide evidence SMC-specific Klf4- versus Oct4-knockout ApoE-/- mice showed virtually opposite genomic signatures and putative SMC Klf4 or Oct4 target genes play an important role regulating SMC phenotypic changes. more...

(Submitter supplied) Recent studies using human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) have developed protocols to induce kidney-lineage cells and reconstruct kidney organoids. However, the separate generation of metanephric nephron progenitors (NPs), mesonephric NPs and ureteric bud (UB) cells, which constitute embryonic kidneys, in in vitro differentiation culture systems has not been fully investigated. Here we created a culture system in which these mesoderm-like cell types as well as paraxial and lateral plate mesoderm-like cells were separately generated from hPSCs. more...

535. Mitochondrial fusion drives oxidative metabolism to immortalize neural stem cells during tumorigenesis
(Submitter supplied) Metabolic reprogramming is a key feature of many cancers, but how and when it contributes to tumorigenesis remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that metabolic reprogramming induced by mitochondrial fusion can be rate-limiting for immortalization of tumor initiating cells (TICs) and trigger their irreversible dedication to tumorigenesis. Using single-cell transcriptomics, we find that Drosophila brain tumors contain a rapidly dividing stem cell population defined by upregulation of oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos). more...

539. Single cell and population transcriptomics reveal epithelial remodeling in type 2-high asthma
(Submitter supplied) BACKGROUND: The type 2 cytokine-high asthma endotype (T2H) is characterized by IL-13-driven mucus obstruction of the airways. To investigate this poorly understood pathobiology, we characterized IL-13 effects on human airway epithelial cultures using single cell RNA-sequencing, finding that IL-13 generated a novel transcriptional state for each cell type. Specifically, we discovered a mucus secretory program induced by IL-13 in all cell types which converted both mucus and defense secretory cells into a metaplastic state with emergent mucin production and secretion, while leading to ER stress and cell death in ciliated cells. more...

(Submitter supplied) Tumors are complex ecosystems, in which malignant and non-malignant cells engage in continuous interactions. Cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are the most abundant non-malignant cells in the majority of carcinomas. The wide range of activities that CAFs perform suggests a dynamic and heterogeneous composition, yet tumor infiltrating CAF subpopulations remain poorly characterized. Here we used single-cell RNA sequencing, index sorting and bulk RNA sequencing to map CAFs at various stages of tumor progression and metastasis.

(Submitter supplied) Recombinant cytokines were the first modern immunotherapies to produce durable cures in metastatic cancer, but their application has been hampered by only modest efficacy and limited tolerability. Next-generation cytokine therapies are therefore under development to overcome the biological limitations of native cytokines. By analyzing single-cell transcriptomic data from tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL), we found that components of the Interleukin-18 (IL-18) pathway are upregulated on activated and dysfunctional TIL, suggesting that IL-18 therapy could potentially restore anti-tumor immunity by stimulating these key effector cells. more...

652. GMM-Demux: sample demultiplexing, multiplet detection, experiment planning and novel cell type verification in single cell sequencing.
(Submitter supplied) Identifying and removing multiplets is essential to improving the scalability and the reliability of single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Multiplets create artificial cell types in the dataset. We propose a Gaussian-mixture-model-based multiplet identification method, GMM-Demux. GMM-Demux accurately identifies and removes multiplets through sample barcoding, including cell hashing and MULTI-seq. GMM-Demux uses a droplet formation model to authenticate putative cell types discovered from a scRNA-seq dataset. We generated two in-house cell hashing datasets and compared GMM-Demux against three state-of-the-art sample barcoding classifiers. We show that GMM-Demux is stable, highly accurate and recognized 9 multiplet-induced fake cell types in a PBMC dataset.

685. Single cell heterogeneity in influenza A virus gene expression shapes the innate antiviral response to infection
(Submitter supplied) Viral infection outcomes are governed by the complex and dynamic interplay between the infecting virus population and the host response. It is increasingly clear that both viral and host cell populations are highly heterogeneous, but little is known about how this heterogeneity influences infection dynamics or viral pathogenicity. To dissect the interactions between influenza A virus (IAV) and host cell heterogeneity, we examined the combined host and viral transcriptomes of thousands of individual cells, each infected with a single IAV virion. more...

686. Single-cell lineage analysis reveals genetic and epigenetic interplay in glioblastoma drug resistance
(Submitter supplied) Drug resistance is a central problem in cancer therapy, yet the underlying mechanisms remain obscure. Cancer cells typically acquire resistance via genetic mutations, but may also adopt reversible epigenetic phenotypes that allow them to persist through drug exposure. In glioblastoma, poor efficacy of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) therapies has been alternatively ascribed to genetic heterogeneity or to epigenetic transitions that circumvent signaling blockade.

The regulators that control monocyte tissue adaptation in the gut remain poorly understood. Interferon Regulatory Factor 5 (IRF5) is a transcription factor previously shown to play a key role in maintaining the inflammatory phenotype of macrophages Here we investigate the impact of IRF5 on the MNP system and physiology of the gut at homeostasis and during inflammation. more...

714. A Platform to Define Cellular Targets of SARS-COV-2 Infection Using Human Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Cells and Organoids
(Submitter supplied) The SARS-CoV-2 virus has already caused over a million COVID-19 cases and over fifty-thousand deaths globally. There is an urgent need to create novel models to study SARS-CoV-2 virus using human disease-relevant cells and tissues to understand key features of virus biology. We present a platform comprised of nine different cell and organoid derivatives from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) representing all three primary germ layers, including lung progenitors and alveolar type II (AT2) cells, pancreatic endocrine cells, liver organoids, endothelial cells, cardiomyocytes, macrophages, microglia, and both cortical and dopaminergic neurons. more...

717. A Single-cell Transcriptomic Atlas of Primate Pancreatic Islet Aging
(Submitter supplied) Aging-related degeneration of pancreatic islet cells contributes to impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes. Endocrine cells age heterogeneously, complicating the effort to unravel the molecular drives underlying endocrine aging. To overcome these obstacles, we undertook single-cell RNA sequencing of pancreatic islet cells obtained from young and aged non-diabetic cynomolgus monkeys. Despite sex differences and increased single-cell level transcriptional variations, aged β-cells showed increased unfolded protein response (UPR) along with the accumulation of protein aggregates. more...

718. Single cell RNAseq analysis revealed long-lasting adverse effects of prenatal tamoxifen administration on neurogenesis
(Submitter supplied) We report that administration of tamoxifen (TAM) during early stages of cortical neurogenesis promoted precocious neural differentiation, while it inhibited neural progenitor cell (NPC) proliferation. The TAM-induced inhibition of NPC proliferation led to deficits in cortical neurogenesis, dendritic morphogenesis, synaptic formation, and cortical patterning in neonatal and postnatal offspring. Mechanistically, by employing single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis combined with in vivo and in vitro assays, we showed TAM could exert these drastic effects mainly through dysregulating Wnt-Dmrta2 signaling pathway.

748. Herpes Simplex Virus 1 and Adeno Associated Virus distribution in neurons of the murine trigeminal and superior cervical ganglia
(Submitter supplied) After initial infection at mucosa, herpes simplex virus (HSV) establishes lifelong latency in neurons of the peripheral nervous system, which represents the source of recurrent disease. Current antiviral therapies reduce symptoms and viral shedding, but do not cure the infection. In contrast, gene editing offers the possibility to lethally mutate or even eliminate latent viral genomes. Delivery of gene editing enzymes by Adeno Associated Virus (AAV) vectors represents a promising approach to functionally curing HSV infection. more...

751. Mapping the effects of developmental lead (Pb) exposure on the hippocampus with single cell analysis
(Submitter supplied) Lead (Pb) exposure is ubiquitous with permanent neurodevelopmental effects. The hippocampus brain region is involved in learning and memory with heterogeneous cellular composition. The hippocampus cell type-specific responses to Pb are unknown. This experiement sought to examine perinatal Pb treatment effects on adult hippocampus gene expression, at the level of individual cells. In mice perinatally exposed to control water or a human physiologically-relevant level (32 ppm in maternal drinking water) of Pb, two weeks prior to mating through weaning, we tested for hippocampus gene expression and cellular differences at 5-months of age.

781. Stat3-Bdnf-TrkB axis promotes alveolar regeneration [scRNA-seq]
(Submitter supplied) Regenerating new alveolar epithelium is essential for recovery from many lung diseases. This multi-cellular regenerative process occurs when type II alveolar pneumocytes (AT2), with support from mesenchymal niche cells, proliferate to generate more AT2 cells and transdifferentiate in type I pneumocytes. To elucidate how coordinated events between AT2 cells and mesenchyme restore alveolar epithelium we used unbiased genome-wide analysis of chromatin accessibility and gene expression in both cell types following acute lung injury. more...

(Submitter supplied) Studies in animal models have been fundamental for understanding brain development but only a fraction of these findings have been validated in a human context. Here, we tissue-engineered a model (MiSTR) of human neural tube regionalization based on human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and microfluidic cell culturing. By exposing differentiating hESCs to a WNT signalling gradient we mimicked early rostro-caudal neural patterning, and with >80% reproducibility generated a coherent tissue with progressive caudalization from forebrain over midbrain to hindbrain, including formation of isthmic organiser characteristics. more...

(Submitter supplied) Here, we observed that the activity of Rad 51, a key modulator of homologous recombination repair (HRR) is lower in somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT)-derived eggs than in conventional IVF, and found a significantly lower level of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in SCNT eggs during reprogramming. To address this difference, supplementation with RS-1, an activator of Rad51, during the activation of SCNT eggs can increase RAD51 expression and DSB foci and thereby overcome the developmental block. more...

820. Dissecting the onset of random X-chromosome inactivation at high temporal and allelic resolution
(Submitter supplied) To ensure dosage compensation between the sexes, one randomly chosen X chromosome is silenced in each female cell in the process of X-chromosome inactivation (XCI). XCI is a model for cellular decision making and epigenetic gene regulation. The random cell-autonomous nature of XCI however has so far prevented its chromosome-wide investigation in its endogenous context without genetic perturbation. Here we use allele-specific single-cell RNA-sequencing to assess the onset of random XCI with high temporal resolution in differentiating mouse embryonic stem cells, and develop dedicated analysis approaches. more...

844. PD-L1 Engagement on T cells Promotes Self-tolerance and  Suppression of Neighboring Macrophages and Effector T cells in Cancer
(Submitter supplied) PD-1 ligation delimits immunogenic responses in T cells. However, the consequences of PD-L1 ligation in T cells are uncertain. We found that T cell expression of PD-L1 in cancer was regulated by tumor-antigen, microbial signals, and sterile inflammatory cues. PD-L1+ T cells exerted tumor-promoting tolerance via three distinct mechanisms: (i) Binding of PD-L1 induced STAT3-dependent back-signaling in CD4+ T cells preventing activation, reducing Th1-polarization, and directing Th17-differentiation. more...

850. Single Cell RNA-sequencing of murine back skin interfollicular epidermis basal cells
(Submitter supplied) The ability of the skin to grow in response to stretching has, for decades, been exploited in reconstructive surgery. The response of epidermal cells to stretching has been studied in vitro. However, it remains unclear how mechanical forces affect epidermal cell behaviour in vivo. Here, we develop a mouse model in which the consequences of stretching on skin epidermis can be studied. Using a multidisciplinary approach that combines clonal analysis with quantitative modelling and single-cell RNA-seq, we show that stretching induces skin expansion by a transient bias in the renewal activity of epidermal stem cells, while a second subpopulation of basal progenitors remains committed to differentiation. more...

Here we examined the role of cooperativity in Notch signaling by CRISPR-mediated engineering of mice in which neither Notch1 nor Notch2 can homo- or heterodimerize, essential for cooperative binding to sequence paired sites (SPS) located near many Notch-regulated genes. While most known Notch-dependent phenotypes were unaffected in Notch1/2 dimer-deficient mice, a subset of tissues proved highly sensitive to loss of cooperativity. more...

876. Anti-human TREM2 induces microglia proliferation and reduces pathology in an Alzheimer's Disease model
(Submitter supplied) TREM2 is a receptor for lipids expressed in microglia. The R47H variant of human TREM2 impairs ligand binding and increases Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) risk. In mouse models of amyloid b (Ab) accumulation, defective TREM2 function affects microglial response to Ab plaques exacerbating tissue damage, whereas TREM2 overexpression attenuates pathology. Thus, AD may benefit from TREM2 activation. Here, we examined the impact of an anti-human TREM2 agonistic mAb, AL002c, in a mouse AD model expressing either the common variant (CV) or the R47H variant of TREM2. more...

877. Single-cell transcriptome reveals the novel role of T-bet in suppressing the immature NK gene signature  the immature NK gene signature
(Submitter supplied) Using scRNAseq, we identified five distinct NK cell clusters and define their relative developmental maturity in the murine bone marrow of WT mice. Transcriptome-based machine-learning classifiers revealed that half of the mTORC2-deficient NK cells belongs to the least mature NK cluster. Mechanistically, loss of mTORC2 results in an increased expression of signature genes representing immature NK cells. more...

(Submitter supplied) The mechanism through which lymphoma-associated EZH2 gain-of-function mutations disrupt the immune system to initiate malignant transformation is poorly understood. Conditional expression of mutant Ezh2 in germinal center (GC) B-cells provides a competitive advantage to activated B-cells in expanding the GC light zone (LZ) that is not caused by failure to differentiate and exit the GC. Instead, the LZ enlargement is explained by reduced apoptosis of Ezh2 mutant centrocytes, aberrant LZ proliferation, and failure of these centrocytes to re-enter the dark zone (DZ). more...

910. LKB1 expressed in dendritic cells governs the development and expansion of thymus-derived regulatory T cells
(Submitter supplied) Liver Kinase B1 (LKB1) plays a key role in cellular metabolism by controlling AMPK activation. However, its function in dendritic cell (DC) biology has not been addressed. Here, we find that LKB1 functions as a critical brake on DC immunogenicity, and when lost, leads to reduced mitochondrial fitness and increased maturation, migration, and T cell priming of peripheral DCs. Concurrently, loss of LKB1 in DCs enhances their capacity to promote output of regulatory T cells (Tregs) from the thymus, which dominates the outcome of peripheral immune responses, as suggested by increased resistance to asthma and higher susceptibility to cancer in CD11cΔLKB1 mice. more...

911. single-cell mRNA sequencing of human embryonic pancreas
(Submitter supplied) A drastic transition at birth, from constant maternal nutrient supply in utero to intermittent postnatal feeding, requires changes in the metabolic system. Despite their central role in metabolic homeostasis, little is known about how pancreatic beta cells adjust to the new nutritional program. Our experiments show that after birth beta cells shift from amino acid- to glucose-stimulated insulin secretion that correlates with the nutritional environment of the animal. more...

Recently, reinvigoration of exhausted CD8+ T cells following PD-1 blockade was shown to be CD28-dependent in mouse models. Herein, we examined the role of CD28 in anti-PD-1-induced human T-cell reinvigoration using tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells (CD8+ TILs) obtained from non-small cell lung cancer patients. more...

942. Single cell transcriptomics analysis of bone marrow mesenchymal lineage cells
(Submitter supplied) Bone marrow mesenchymal lineage cells are a heterogeneous cell population involved in bone homeostasis and diseases such as osteoporosis. While it is long postulated that they originate from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), the true identity of MSCs and their in vivo bifurcated differentiation routes into osteoblasts and adipocytes remain poorly understood. Here, by employing large scale single cell transcriptome analysis, we computationally defined MSCs and delineated their bi-lineage differentiation paths in young, adult and aging mice. more...

960. Redundant and additive functions of the four LEF/TCF transcription factors in lung epithelial progenitors
(Submitter supplied) Paralogs represent genetic redundancy and survive purifying selection by evolving overlapping and distinct functions. In multicellular organisms, such functional diversification can manifest as tissue and cell type specific expression, which masks possible selective pressure for genetic redundancy within a single cell type. Using in vivo genetic and genomic analyses, we show that although the 4 mammalian LEF/TCF transcription factors have evolved organ-specific functions, they function additively and redundantly, depending on gene dosage, to promote lung epithelial progenitors and do so in a linear, positive manner with beta-Catenin in the canonical Wnt signaling pathway.

However, loss of HDAC3 also represses transcription. Here we report that, during lipopolysaccharide (LPS) activation of macrophages, the deacetylase activity of HDAC3 is selectively engaged at ATF3-bound enhancers that repress anti-inflammatory genes. more...

975. Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals compromised immune microenvironment in precursor stages of multiple myeloma
(Submitter supplied) Precursor states of Multiple Myeloma (MM) and its native tumor microenvironment need in-depth molecular characterization to better stratify and treat patients at risk. Using single-cell RNA sequencing of bone marrow cells from precursor stages, MGUS and smoldering myeloma (SMM), to full-blown MM alongside healthy donors, we demonstrate early immune changes during patient progression. We find NK cell abundance is frequently increased in early stages, and associated with altered chemokine receptor expression. more...

Lineage tracing demonstrates that many glandular epithelia initially develop from multipotent basal stem cells (BaSCs) that are replaced in adult life by distinct pool of unipotent stem cells (SCs). However, adult unipotent BaSC can reactivate multipotency and give rise to LCs upon transplantation or oncogene expression, demonstrating the important plasticity of BaSCs in regenerative and pathological conditions, and suggesting that an active mechanism restricts multipotency in BaSCs during physiological conditions. more...

1007. Dysfunction of hair follicle mesenchymal progenitors contributes to age related hair loss
(Submitter supplied) Advanced age drives the progressive degeneration of mammalian hair follicles (HF) and termination of its regeneration cycle. The role of hair follicle dermal stem cell (hfDSC) in this age-associated HF dysfunction remains largely unexplored. Here, we first characterize a novel function of hfDSCs in regenerating the full dermal papilla (DP) after laser ablation. Next, we performed long-term fate mapping, age-dependant in vivo clonal analysis and in vitro proliferation assay on hfDSCs to describe the age-related defects in mesenchymal stem cell self-renewal and differentiation capabilities. more...

1039. Dissection of the 4D chromatin structure of the alpha-globin locus through in vivo erythroid differentiation with extreme spatial and temporal resolution [CITE-seq]
(Submitter supplied) Precise gene expression patterns during mammalian development are controlled by regulatory elements in the non-coding genome. Active enhancer elements interact with gene promoters within Topologically Associating Domains (TADs). However, the precise relationships between chromatin accessibility, nuclear architecture and gene activation are not completely understood. Here, we present Tiled-C, a new Chromosome Conformation Capture (3C) technology, which allows for the generation of high-resolution contact matrices of loci of interest at unprecedented depth, and which can be optimized for as few as 2,000 cells of input material. more...

1040. Foxp1 drives striatal projection neuron specification and organization via cell-type specific mechanism
(Submitter supplied) The molecular mechanisms that underlie striatal development and organization remain largely unknown. Here, we show that Foxp1, a transcription factor strongly linked to autism and intellectual disability, regulates organizational features of striatal circuitry in a cell-type dependent fashion. Using single-cell RNA-sequencing, we examine the cellular diversity of the early postnatal striatum and demonstrate that Foxp1 specifies a subpopulation of indirect pathway spiny projection neurons (iSPNs) while maintaining the striosome-matrix architecture through molecular mechanisms mediated by direct pathway spiny projection neurons (dSPNs). more...

1041. Characterizing the temporal dynamics of gene expression in single cells with sci-fate
(Submitter supplied) Gene expression is a dynamic process on multiple scales, e.g. the cell cycle, response to stimuli, normal differentiation and development, etc. However, nearly all techniques for profiling gene expression in single cells fail to directly capture these temporal dynamics, which limits the scope of biology that can be effectively investigated. Towards addressing this, we developed sci-fate, a new technique that combines S4U labeling of newly synthesized mRNA with single cell combinatorial indexing (sci-), in order to concurrently profile the whole and newly synthesized transcriptome in each of many single cells. more...

Here we reveal a previously unappreciated heterogeneity in the biosynthetic capacities of CRC cells. We discover that the majority of ribosomal DNA transcription and protein synthesis in CRCs occur in a limited subset of tumor cells that localize in defined niches. The rest of the tumor cells undergo an irreversible loss of their biosynthetic capacities as a consequence of differentiation. more...

1055. Characterization of cochlear development at the single cell level
(Submitter supplied) The organ of Corti, located in the floor of the scala media of the cochlea, acts as the primary sensory transducer of sound in mammals.  This remarkable structure comprises a highly diverse cellular mosaic that includes two unique types of mechanosensory hair cells and an undefined number of associated supporting cell types.  All of these cells are believed to arise from a developmental equivalence group referred to as the prosensory domain that is similarly thought to arise from a proneurosensory population that develops in the anterior-ventral region of the otocyst.  The results of both classical embryologic manipulations and modern molecular genetic experiments suggest that otocyst precursor cells proceed through several rounds of lineage restriction that progressively specify subsets of cells as prosensory cells and ultimately as either hair cells or supporting cells.  However, the relatively small sizes of the otocyst and inner ear have hindered efforts to determine the full diversity of cell types within the mature cochlea and to identify the transitional cell types that exist during development.  The recent development of droplet-based methods for isolation and subsequent transcriptional profiling of individual cells provides a potential method to address both of these challenges.  Therefore, we dissected, dissociated and then captured over 27,000 epithelial cells from the developing cochlear duct at specific time points between E14 and P7.

1081. A combinatorial code of transcription factors specifies subtypes of visual motion-sensing neurons in Drosophila
(Submitter supplied) Direction-selective T4/T5 neurons exist in four subtypes, each tuned to visual motion along one of the four cardinal directions. Along with their directional tuning, neurons of each T4/T5 subtype orient their dendrites and project their axons in a subtype-specific manner. Directional tuning, thus, appears strictly linked to morphology in T4/T5 neurons. How the four T4/T5 subtypes acquire their distinct morphologies development remains largely unknown. more...

1083. Perinatal cardiomyocyte maturation reference isolated by large-particle fluorescence activated cell sorting
(Submitter supplied) To date, there have been limited high quality libraries of cardiomyocyte maturation during the perinatal period, in part owing to the difficulty of isolating large perinatal cardiomyocytes. We previously developed a method utilizing large-particle fluorescent activated cell sorting (LP-FACS) to isolate adult cardiomyocytes for single cell RNA-seq (Kannan et al., Circ Res, 2019). We utilize this method to generate a reference of perinatal cardiomyocyte maturation.

1084. Tumor-derived retinoic acid regulates intratumoral monocyte differentiation to promote immune suppression and resistance to immune checkpoint blockade
(Submitter supplied) The immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) is a major barrier to immunotherapy. Within solid tumors, why monocytes preferentially differentiate into immunosuppressive tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) but not immunostimulatory dendritic cells (DCs) remains unclear. Using multiple murine sarcoma models, we found that the TME induced retinoic acid (RA) production by tumor cells, which polarized intratumoral monocyte differentiation towards TAMs and away from DCs via suppression of DC-promoting transcription factor Irf4. more...

1088. Molecular diversity of auditory critical period plasticity revealed by single-nucleus RNA sequencing
(Submitter supplied) Auditory experience drives neural circuit refinement during auditory circuit development, but little is known about the genetic regulation of this developmental process. The primary auditory cortex (A1) exhibits a critical period for thalamocortical connectivity between postnatal days P12 and P15, during which tone exposure alters the tonotopic topography of A1. We hypothesized that a coordinated, multicellular transcriptional program governs this window for patterning of the auditory cortex. more...

1101. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis of adult mouse pituitary reveals sexual dimorphism and physiologic demand-induced cellular plasticity
(Submitter supplied) The anterior pituitary gland drives a set of highly conserved physiologic processes in mammalian species. These hormonally controlled processes are central to somatic growth, pubertal transformation, fertility, lactation, and metabolism. Current models, largely based on candidate gene based immuno-histochemical and mRNA analyses, suggest that each of the seven hormones synthesized by the pituitary is produced by a specific and exclusive cell-lineage. more...

(Submitter supplied) While conventional dendritic cells (DC)1 and DC2 are found in tumors, DC1 were shown to control tumor response to checkpoint blockade in preclinical models and are associated with better overall survival in cancer patients, reflecting their specialized ability to prime CD8+ T cell responses. Paradoxically, DC1 can also be found in tumors that resist checkpoint blockade, suggesting that, like many tumor infiltrating T cells, DC1 functionality may be altered in tumors. more...

1134. Hair-bearing human skin generated entirely from pluripotent stem cells
(Submitter supplied) In this study, we defined a differentiation approach for guiding human pluripotent stem cells in to complex hair-bearing skin tissue, known as skin organoids. The primary goal of this single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis was to define the cellular composition of skin organoids, which we have shown using histology contain multiple embryonic cell lineages. The secondary goal was to determine whether skin organoids generated using different cell lines (WA25 hESCs and DSP-GFP hiPSCs) contain similar cell types.

Recent findings suggest that reduced neurogenesis could be one of the reasons underlying the exacerbated neuropathology in humans, and restoring the neural stem cell proliferation and neurogenesis could help circumventing some pathological aspects of Alzheimer’s disease. We recently identified Interleukin-4/STAT6 signaling as a neuron-glia crosstalk mechanism that enables glial proliferation and neurogenesis in adult zebrafish brain and 3D cultures of human astroglia, which manifest neurogenic properties. more...

1166. Single cell RNA-Seq adult mouse skin during homeostasis and wound repair
(Submitter supplied) Our knowledge of transcriptional heterogeneities in epithelial stem/progenitor cell compartments is limited. Epidermal basal cells sustain cutaneous tissue maintenance and drive wound healing. Previous studies have probed basal cell heterogeneity in stem/progenitor potential, but a comprehensive dissection of basal cell dynamics during differentiation is lacking. Using single-cell RNA-sequencing coupled with RNAScope and fluorescence lifetime imaging, we identify three non-proliferative and one proliferative basal cell transcriptional states in homeostatic skin that differ in metabolic preference and become spatially partitioned during wound re-epithelialization. more...

1199. A single cell atlas of tumor resistance to PD-1 blockade and radiotherapy: Bulk Tumor RNA Sequencing
(Submitter supplied) Abstract: Transplanted tumors in syngeneic mice treated with immune checkpoint blockade and radiotherapy demonstrate synergy and an abscopal effect. Indeed, tumors generated from sarcoma cell lines transplanted into syngeneic mice are cured by PD-1 blockade and radiotherapy, but autochthonous, primary sarcomas from the same high mutational load model are resistant to the identical treatment. Here, we generated a single cell atlas of tumor-infiltrating immune cells from allograft and primary tumors, which demonstrates marked differences in their immune landscapes before and after radiation and immunotherapy. more...

(Submitter supplied) Despite the recent application of single-cell RNA-sequencing to aspects of mouse skin biology, the full cellular heterogeneity of the mouse skin (including both epidermis and skin stroma) and its relationship with the hair cycle is still uncharted. In order to systematically compare the cellular composition of mouse skin during rest and hair growth, we created single-cell RNA-sequencing libraries from full thickness mouse skin cell suspensions sampled during anagen (5w) and telogen (9w).

1203. Gonadotropin surge-induced expression of progesterone receptor serves the ovary as a trigger of ovulation and a terminator of ovulatory inflammation
(Submitter supplied) Ovulation is triggered by the gonadotropin surge that induces the expression of two key genes, progesterone receptor (Pgr) and prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (Ptgs2) in the granulosa cells of preovulatory follicles.  Their gene products PGR and PTGS2 activate two separate pathways that are both essential for successful ovulation. Here we show that the PGR plays an additional essential role; attenuate ovulatory inflammation by diminishing the gonadotropin surge-induced Ptgs2 expression. more...

1232. Tandem CTCF sites function as insulators to balance spatial chromatin contacts and topological enhancer-promoter selection [I]
(Submitter supplied) CTCF is a key insulator-binding protein and mammalian genomes contain numerous CTCF-binding sites (CBSs), many of which are organized in tandem arrays. Here we provide direct evidence that CBSs, if located between enhancers and promoters in the clustered Pcdh and b-globin clusters, function as an enhancer-blocking insulator by forming distinct directional chromatin loops, regardless whether enhancers contain CBS or not. more...

1262. Caloric restriction reprograms the single-cell transcriptional landscape of Rattus norvegicus aging
(Submitter supplied) Aging causes a functional decline in tissues throughout the body that may be delayed by caloric restriction (CR). However, the cellular profiles and signatures of aging, as well as those ameliorated by CR, remain unclear. Here, we built comprehensive single-cell and single-nucleus transcriptomic atlases across various rat tissues undergoing aging and CR. CR attenuated aging-related changes in cell type composition, gene expression, and core transcriptional regulatory networks. more...

1263. Glioblastoma epigenome profiling identifies SOX10 as a master regulator of molecular tumour subtype - mouse RNAseq experiments
(Submitter supplied) Glioblastomas in adult patients are classified into four subtypes, IDH, MES, RTK I, and RTK II, based on DNA-methylation and RNA-expression data. Tumour subtype transitions are common during treatment, and transitions to the mesenchymal (MES) subtype are associated with therapy resistance and adverse prognosis. Here, we present DNA methylome and histone modification data of glioblastoma primary tumours and find that glioblastoma subtypes differ in their enhancer landscapes. more...

Here we establish a robust method for identification of global transcriptomic changes in rare metastatic cells during seeding using single-cell RNA-sequencing and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of breast cancer. We find that both primary tumours and micrometastases display transcriptional heterogeneity, but micrometastases harbor a distinct transcriptome program conserved across PDX models that is highly predictive of poor survival in patients. more...

1276. Pbx4 limits vertebrate heart size and promotes pharyngeal arch artery development through partitioning progenitor fates within the second heart field and restricting proliferation
(Submitter supplied) Development of the vertebrate heart requires the appropriate integration of temporally-distinct differentiating progenitor populations. While factors that promote accrual of later-differentiating second heart field (SHF)-derived cells to the outflow tract (OFT) have been intensively investigated, few signals are understood that specifically restrict the size of the vertebrate OFT. Here, we show that improper specification and proliferation of SHF progenitors in zebrafish lazarus (lzr) mutants, which lack the transcription factor Pbx4, produces enlarged hearts with a specific increase in ventricular cardiomyocytes and smooth muscle cells within the OFT. more...

1302. In vivo high-throughput screening of novel adeno-associated viral capsids identifies variants for transduction of adult neural stem cells within the subventricular zone
(Submitter supplied) The adult mammalian brain entails a reservoir of neural stem cells (NSCs) generating glial cells and neurons. However, NSCs become increasingly quiescent with age, which hampers their regenerative capacity. New means are therefore required to genetically modify adult NSCs for re-enabling endogenous brain repair. Recombinant adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) are ideal gene therapy vectors due to an excellent safety profile and high transduction efficiency. more...

1303. Defining the adult hippocampal neural stem cell secretome: in vivo versus in vitro transcriptomic differences and their correlation to secreted protein levels.
(Submitter supplied) Recent evidence shows that adult hippocampal neural stem and progenitor cells (NSPCs) secrete a variety of proteins that affect tissue function. Though several individual NSPC-derived proteins have been shown to impact cellular processes like neuronal maturation and stem cell maintenance, a broad characterization of NSPC-secreted factors is lacking. Secretome profiling of low abundance stem cell populations is typically achieved via proteomic characterization of in vitro, isolated cells. more...

(Submitter supplied) Leukemia stem cells (LSCs) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are believed to possess distinct biological properties than the bulk AML cells, but their rarity and the unavailability of universal immunophenotypic markers for their prospective isolation hampers their study. We report that hematopoietic cells from genetically clonal AML patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) contain two morphologically and immunophenotypically distinct subpopulations: a cell fraction with a hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) immunophenotype exhibiting adherent growth which we termed induced leukemai stem cells (iLSCs) and a non-adherent fraction of more differentiated cells, which we termed induced blasts (iBlasts). more...

1305. DNA methylation disruption reshapes the hematopoietic differentiation landscape
(Submitter supplied) Somatic mutations in genes implicated in DNA methylation (DNAme; e.g., TET2, DNMT3A and IDH2), are frequently observed in hematological malignancies, as well as in clonal hematopoiesis (CH). Yet, how these mutations disrupt the hematopoietic differentiation topology remains largely unknown.  By applying complementary single-cell sequencing approaches to murine bone marrow hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, we observe that mutations in DNAme modifiers result in significantly altered differentiation topology. more...

1328. Dissecting the early steps of MLL induced leukaemogenic transformation using a new mouse model of AML
(Submitter supplied) Leukaemogenic mutations commonly disrupt cellular differentiation and/or enhance proliferation, thus perturbing the regulatory programs that control self-renewal and differentiation of stem and progenitor cells. Translocations involving the Mll1 (Kmt2a) gene generate powerful oncogenic fusion proteins, predominantly affecting infant and paediatric AML and ALL patients. The early stages of leukaemogenic transformation are typically inaccessible from human patients and conventional mouse models. more...

(Submitter supplied) Smarcad1 is one of the most conserved chromatin remodelling factors, from yeast to human, with suggested functions in gene silencing, heterochromatin maintenance and genome stability. However, its role in tissue function is poorly understood. As this factor is highly expressed in the stem- and proliferative zone in the intestinal epithelium, we explored the role of this factor in this tissue. Intestine tissue-specific deletion of Smarcad1 resulted in notable changes in gene expression in the small intestine, colon and organoids from small intestine. more...

Animal studies demonstrated, however, that neuronal EPO effects are independent of an elevated hematocrit. Here, we show with a novel line of reporter mice that cognitive challenge leads to local/endogenous hypoxia in hippocampal pyramidal neurons where it induces enhanced expression of both EPO and EPO receptor (EPOR). more...

Here we generated a map of the human brain transcriptome by assessing the gene expression levels in 33 distinct regions representing all major brain structures from four adult cognitively healthy human individuals, three chimpanzees, three bonobos, and three rhesus macaques. more...

(Submitter supplied) Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) causes a lifelong infection through establishment of latency. Although reactivation from latency can cause life-threatening disease, our molecular understanding of HCMV latency is incomplete. Here we use single cell RNA-seq analysis to characterize latency in monocytes and hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). In monocytes, we identify host cell surface markers that enable enrichment of latent cells harboring higher viral transcript levels, which can reactivate more efficiently, and are characterized by an intrinsic reduced immune response that is critical for viral gene expression. more...

Here, we identify heart-resident PDGFRa+ SCA-1+ cells as cardiac Fibro/Adipogenic Progenitors (cFAPs) and show that they respond to ischemic damage by generating SCA-1- fibrogenic cells. Pharmacological blockade of this differentiation step with an anti-fibrotic tyrosine kinase inhibitor decreases post-myocardial infarction (MI) remodeling and leads to improvement in heart function.

(Submitter supplied) The testis expresses the largest number of genes of any mammalian organ, a finding that has long puzzled molecular biologists. Our detailed transcriptomic map of human and mouse spermatogenesis provides evidence that this widespread transcription serves to maintain DNA sequence integrity in the male germline by correcting DNA damage through “transcriptional scanning”. Supporting this model, we find that genes expressed during spermatogenesis display lower mutation rates on the transcribed strand and have low diversity in the population, while unexpressed genes evolve faster and are enriched for sensory and immune-defense functions. more...

How Cdkn1c regulates corticogenesis is however not clear. To this end we employ Mosaic Analysis with Double Markers (MADM) technology to genetically dissect Cdkn1c gene function in corticogenesis at single cell resolution. We find that the previously described growth-inhibitory Cdkn1c function is a non-cell-autonomous one, acting on the whole organism. more...

1424. Treatment-induced tumor dormancy through YAP-mediated transcriptional reprogramming of the apoptotic pathway [scRNASeq]
(Submitter supplied) Eradicating tumor dormancy that develops following oncogene-targeted therapy, including after epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment of EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), is an attractive therapeutic strategy but the mechanisms governing the establishment of tumor dormancy are poorly understood. We observe that blockade of ERK1/2 reactivation following EGFR TKI treatment by combined EGFR/MEK inhibition uncovers cells that survive by entering a senescence-like dormant state, characterized by extensive epigenetic remodeling and high YAP/TEAD activity. more...

(Submitter supplied) Acetamide (CAS 60-35-5) is detected in common foods including milk, eggs, beef, and roasted coffee beans. Chronic rodent bioassays using high doses (≥1000 mg/kg/day) suggest acetamide is a group 2B possible human carcinogen due to the induction of liver tumors. Weight-of-evidence indicates acetamide is not genotoxic, and therefore a threshold response is expected. We used a toxicogenomics approach in Wistar rats gavaged daily for 7 and 28 days to determine the benchmark dose (BMD), and investigate its mode of action from differential gene expression. more...

(Submitter supplied) Background: Unbiased studies using different genome-wide methods have identified several promising novel biomarkers for diagnosis and treatment response in Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). However, clinical translation has proven difficult. Here, we hypothesized that one reason could be that inflammatory responses in peripheral blood are different from those in the arthritic joint. Methods: We performed meta-analysis of gene expression microarray data from synovium, whole blood cells (WBC), peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), and CD4+ T cells from patients with RA and healthy control in order to identify overlapping pathways, predicted upstream regulators and potential biomarkers. more...

It has been reported that some types of TEs are dynamically regulated in the reprogramming of human cell lines. However, it is largely unknown whether some TEs in Macaca mulatta are also regulated during the reprogramming of cell lines of monkey. Here, we systematically examined the transcriptional activities of TEs during the conversion of Macaca mulatta fibroblast cells to neuroepithelial stem cells (NESCs). more...

1488. Functional stem cell aging dictated by skin tissue microenvironment
(Submitter supplied) Organismal aging in mammals is manifested with architectural alteration and functional decline of multiple organs throughout the body. In aged skin, hairs are sparse, which has led to the hypothesis that the hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) undergo epidermal differentiation during aging. Here, we employ single cell analysis to interrogate aging-related changes in the HFSCs. Unexpectedly, HFSCs maintain their lineage fidelity and show no signs of shifting to an epidermal fate. more...

(Submitter supplied) The transporter which uptakes pyruvate into the mitochondria during pyruvate oxidation, called the Mitochondrial Pyruvate Carrier (MPC), was only recently identified. While the MPC has been studied in a variety of cell types, including cancer cells and stem cells, very little is known about the importance of MPC in immune cells. Here, we delete MPC from hematopoietic cells and measure its impact on thymocyte gene expression by 10X Genomics scRNA-seq.

1550. Sex chromsomes affect gene expression of healthy CD4+ T cells in B6 gonadal males
(Submitter supplied) To determine the role of sex chromsomes in sex differences of autoimmune disease, we used high throughput RNA sequencing to analyze the transciptomes of CD4+ T cells stimuated with antiCD3/CD28 from XXSry and XY-Sry mice using the “four core genotypes” mouse model. We found higher expression of several X genes in the XY- genotype compared to XX, suggesting a difference in DNA methylation of these genes between Xp and Xm. more...

1551. Transcriptome data from human endocrine cells recovered from mouse grafts with pre-engraftment controls
(Submitter supplied) We examined the transcriptomes of alpha and beta cells recovered from mouse sub-renal capsule grafts of human islets as compared to alpha and beta cells from the same islet preps pre-engraftment. We found that after three to four weeks in the graft the human islets were still glucose responsive, secreting insulin following glucose challenge. In addition, gene expression was largely unchanged from the pre-engraftment control samples.

1552. Integrated single cell analysis of blood and cerebrospinal fluid leukocytes in multiple sclerosis
(Submitter supplied) Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protects the central nervous system (CNS) and analyzing CSF aids the diagnosis of CNS diseases, but our understanding of CSF leukocytes remains superficial. Here, using single cell transcriptomics, we identified a specific border-associated composition and transcriptome of CSF leukocytes. Multiple sclerosis (MS) – an autoimmune disease of the CNS – increased transcriptional diversity in blood, but increased cell type diversity in CSF including a higher abundance of cytotoxic phenotype T helper cells. more...

(Submitter supplied) PRDM14 is a crucial regulator of mouse primordial germ cells (mPGC), epigenetic reprogramming and pluripotency, but its role in the evolutionarily divergent regulatory network of human PGCs (hPGCs) remains unclear. Besides, a previous knockdown study indicated that PRDM14 might be dispensable for human germ cell fate. Here, we decided to use inducible degrons for a more rapid and comprehensive PRDM14 depletion. more...

(Submitter supplied) T cells in mucosal tissues fulfill a complex array of duties to ensure maintenance of barrier immunity. In oral mucosa tissue, we found that increased inflammation altered CD4 T cell subsets in a spatially-dependent manner, although it had a modest effect on the frequency of tissue-resident memory T cells (TRM) and the CD4 T cell transcriptome. In contrast, localization to the tissue profoundly altered the transcriptional profile, emphasizing the importance of studying healthy tissue to understand disease-specific changes. more...

Tumor-associated macrophages/microglia (TAMs) represent the most abundant non-malignant cell type in brain metastasis and are known to support metastatic colonization and outgrowth. We used the colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (Csf1r) inhibitor BLZ945 to target TAMs at distinct stages of the metastatic cascade in experimental breast-to-brain metastasis and demonstrate that Csf1r inhibition leads to anti-tumor responses in prevention and intervention trails. more...

Zebrafish remarkably regenerate their brain by inducing NSC plasticity in a Amyloid-β-42 (Aβ42)-induced experimental Alzheimer’s disease (AD) model. Interleukin-4 (IL-4) is also critical for AD-induced NSC proliferation. However, the mechanisms of this response have remained unknown. Using single-cell transcriptomics in the adult zebrafish brain, we identify distinct subtypes of NSCs and neurons and differentially regulated pathways and their gene ontologies and investigate how cell-cell communication is altered through ligand-receptor pairs in AD conditions. more...

1614. An optimization system for isolating and sequencing of single human colon cancer cells
(Submitter supplied) Single cell sequencing (SCS) is a promising approach for precisely digging into the genetic heterogeneity at single cells level. Single cell whole genome/exome sequencing (scWGS/scWES) and single cell whole transcriptome sequencing (scRNA-seq) are methods of SCS and have been applied in various studies of solid tumors, e.g. liver cancer, breast cancer. However, no scRNA-seq-related studies of human colon-cancer tissue-samples have been conducted. more...

1615. PROX1 mediates chemoresistance-associated recurrence via maintenance of quiescent colon cancer stem cells
(Submitter supplied) Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are profoundly associated with refractory nature of cancer. A quiescent population of CSCs is responsible for tumorigenesis and chemoresistance in leukemia, whereas neither the presence nor clinical importance of the quiescent CSCs is clearly established in solid tumors. In colon cancer, LGR5 is regarded as a functional marker of CSCs, but heterogeneity among LGR5+ cells was not clearly defined. more...

1618. Fine-mapping within eQTL Credible Intervals by E-CROPseq
(Submitter supplied) Precise identification of causal variants within credible intervals of eQTL associations is needed to identify regulatory GWAS variants. We show that CROPseq, namely multiplex CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing combined with single cell RNAseq, is a viable strategy for fine mapping regulatory SNPs.  Mutations were induced nearby 67 SNPs in three genes, two of which, rs2251039 and rs17523802, significantly altered CISD1 and PARK7 expression, respectively, and overlap with chromatin accessibility peaks.

(Submitter supplied) Standard chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) targets proliferative cells and efficiently induces complete remission; however, many patients relapse and die of their disease. Relapse is caused by leukemia stem cells (LSCs), the cells with self-renewal capacity. Self-renewal and proliferation are mutually exclusive in normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in steady state conditions. If these functions are also mutually exclusive in LSCs, then antiproliferative therapies may fail to target self-renewal, allowing for relapse. more...

1644. Spontaneous direct fate conversion of neuroblasts into oligodendrocytes upon demyelination in the adult mouse brain
(Submitter supplied) After demyelinating insult, the neuronal progenitors of the adult mouse sub-ventricular zone (SVZ) called neuroblasts convert into oligodendrocytes that participate to the remyelination process. We use this rare example of spontaneous fate conversion to identify the molecular mechanisms governing these processes. Using single cell RNA-sequencing, we show that SVZ neuroblasts fate conversion proceeds directly, through formation of a non-proliferating transient cellular state co-expressing markers of both neuronal and oligodendrocyte identities. more...

1646. Role of Ikaros in Early B-cell Development: Studies of IkZnF1-/- and IkZnF4-/- mutant mice
(Submitter supplied) Ikaros is a zinc finger (ZnF) transcription factor critical for B-cell development. The C2H2 zinc finger is the most prevalent DNA-binding motif in the mammalian proteome, with DNA-binding domains usually containing more tandem fingers than are needed for stable sequence-specific DNA recognition. To examine the reason for the frequent presence of multiple zinc fingers, we generated mice lacking finger 1 or finger 4 of the 4-finger DNA-binding domain of Ikaros (Schjerven et al., Nat Immunol, 2013; PMID: 24013668). more...

1647. Lineage tracing on transcriptional landscapes links state to fate during differentiation
(Submitter supplied) A challenge in biology is to associate molecular differences among progenitor cells with their capacity to generate mature cell types. Here, we use expressed DNA barcodes to clonally trace transcriptomes over time, applied to study fate determination in hematopoiesis. We identify states of primed fate potential, and locate them on a continuous transcriptional landscape. We identify two routes of monocyte differentiation that leave an imprint on mature cells. more...

1649. The Toxoplasma gondii virulence factor ROP16 acts in cis and trans and suppresses T cell responses [CEP_invivo_Ai6_1dpi]
(Submitter supplied) The ability of Toxoplasma gondii to inject the rhoptry kinase ROP16 into host cells results in the activation of the transcription factors STAT3 and STAT6, but it is unclear how these events impact infection. Here, parasites that inject Cre-recombinase with rhoptry proteins were used to distinguish infected macrophages from those only injected with parasite proteins. Transcriptional profiling revealed that injection of rhoptry proteins alone was sufficient to induce an M2 phenotype that is dependent on STAT3 and STAT6, but only infected cells displayed reduced expression of anti-microbial genes and antigen presentation pathways. more...

However, little is known about the clonal composition and transcriptional heterogeneity of CAR-T cells in the infusion products (IP) and clonal kinetics after adoptive transfer.  We performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on CD8+ CAR-T cells isolated from the IP and the blood of patients treated on a phase 1 clinical trial (NCT01865617) with lymphodepletion chemotherapy and a defined formulation of CD4+ and CD8+ CD19-specific CAR-T cells. more...

The mammalian SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex (mSWI/SNF or BAF) is mutated in over 20% of human cancers and loss of the SMARCB1 gene, encoding the BAF47 protein subunit, results in one of the most aggressive and lethal pediatric cancers. An accumulation of point mutations occurs at the C-terminal end of the protein, for which the functional ramifications are unknown. more...

1654. Single cell RNA sequencing identifies the developmental origin of C-Myc dependent T-bet+thymic intraepithelial lymphocyte precursor
(Submitter supplied) Natural intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) are thymus-derived adaptive immune cells, which are important contributors to intestinal immune homeostasis. Similar to other innate-like T cells they are induced in the thymus through high-avidity interaction that would otherwise lead to clonal deletion in conventional CD4 and CD8 T cells. By applying single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) on a heterogeneous population of IEL precursors (IELPs) we define a developmental trajectory that identifies Id3 as a novel regulator of IELP development and shows that all natural TCRαβ+ IELPs progress through a PD-1 stage as a result of strong agonist selection. more...

However, the transcriptional landscape and genetic regulation processes of the healthy developing brain are not fully characterized, limiting our investigation of these tumors. We used single-cell RNA-sequencing to generate a transcriptomic atlas of >65,000 cells in the developing forebrain and pons in human and mouse, two regions where PBT commonly arise. more...

1675. Characterization of estrogen and the endocrine-disrupting chemical-induced mouse mammary gland reorganization via single-cell RNA-sequencing
(Submitter supplied) Exposure to estrogen and its mimics during menopausal transition is thought to modify the structure of mammary gland. Using a surgical menopausal (ovariectomized) mouse model, we assessed how mammary gland tissue was affected by both 17β-estradiol (E2) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs). Three analyzed flame retardants, BDE-47, BDE-100 and BDE-153, are most frequently detected in human serum from all over the world. more...

1679. Multiplexed RNA-sequencing of 1M immune cells reveals the cellular, molecular, and genetic correlates of systemic lupus erythematosus
(Submitter supplied) Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease defined by a broad range of symptoms that disproportionately affects women Our knowledge of which immune cells mediate the etiology and pathogenesis of the disease remains incomplete Identifying pathogenic cells using bulk gene expression analysis is confounded by the functional overlap and frequency variation of immune cell types Here, we used multiplexed single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) to profile ~1 million peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 134 SLE cases and 58 healthy controls Cases were marked by a reduction of naive CD4+ T cells, clonal restriction of effector memory CD8+ T cells, and elevated expression of interferon-stimulated genes in classical monocytes An additional 15 cases experiencing active disease flares displayed increased expansion of effector memory CD8+ T cells and the presence of macrophages not seen in managed disease Although cell-type-specific expression contributed most to inter-individual expression variability across all cells, cell composition accounted for more variability in genes differentially expressed in cases We integrated dense genotyping data to map thousands of genetic variants, including SLE-associations, whose effects on expression are modified by cell type or interferon activation Population-scale scRNA-seq analysis reveals changes in cell composition and state associated with SLE, and when integrated with genetic data, ascribes function to disease-associated and disease-modified variants

1684. Microglial microRNAs mediate sex-specific responses to tau pathology
(Submitter supplied) Sex is a key modifier of neurological disease outcomes. Microglia are implicated in neurological diseases and modulated by miRNAs, but it is unknown whether microglial miRNAs have sex-specific influences on disease. We show that microglial miRNA expression differs in males and females, and loss of miRNAs leads to sex-specific changes in the microglial transcriptome and to tau pathology. These findings suggest microglial miRNAs influence tau pathogenesis in a sex-specific manner.

1708. Characterization of Fetal Specific Transcriptional Programs in Thymic Epithelial Cells Identifies Myc as a Critical Determinant of Thymus Size [single cell RNA-Seq]
(Submitter supplied) The thymus is the site of T cell development. Although much is known about the development and differentiation of the T lymphocyte compartment, less is known about the thymic epithelial cell (TEC) populations fostering their development. Here we use next generation sequencing approaches to identify transcriptional programs unique to TEC at specific stages of mouse life. This strategy identified Myc as a regulator of the fetal program, driving the rapid expansion in thymic size during fetal life.

1709. CDK2 kinase activity is a regulator of male germ cell fate
(Submitter supplied) The ability of men to remain fertile throughout their lives depends upon establishment of a spermatogonial stem cell (SSC) pool from gonocyte progenitors, and also maintaining the proper balance between SSC renewal and spermatogenic differentiation throughout life. Depletion of SSCs causes infertility with a Sertoli Cell Only Syndrome (SCOS) phenotype. We previously created a mouse strain in which an inhibitory phosphorylation site (Tyr15) of Cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2) was altered. more...

1711. Transcriptional signatures derived from murine tumor-associated macrophages predict  outcome in breast cancer patients
(Submitter supplied) Macrophages are frequently the most abundant immune cells in murine and human cancers. Studies in various transgenic mouse tumor models have revealed pro-tumor functions of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), but despite their association with poor clinical outcome in human patients, molecular signatures for the prediction of clinical outcome in humans are still missingbeen demonstrated. Here we generated molecular signatures from F4/80+CD11b+ TAMs from two transgenic breast cancer models: K14cre;Cdh1flox/flox;Trp53flox/flox (KEP), which resembles human invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) and MMTV-NeuT (NeuT), which resembles HER2-overexpressing breast cancer. more...

1714. Early-life microbial exposure imprints the abundance of mucosal-associated invariant T cells and subsequent interactions modulate their function
(Submitter supplied) How early exposure to the microbiota impacts long-term host immunity remains poorly understood. Here we show that the development of mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells depends on early-life exposure to microbes that synthesize riboflavin, such as Enterobacteriaceae. This microbial imprinting relies on a specific temporal window, after which MAIT cell development is permanently impaired. In adults, MAIT cells are a dominant population of IL-17A-producing lymphocytes within the skin that can subsequently respond to skin commensals in an IL-1 and antigen-dependent manner. more...

1718. scRNA-seq reveals development of a broad spectrum of cell types in human iPSC derived hepatic organoids (HOs) and defines biomarkers in iPSC to liver lineage differentiation stages
(Submitter supplied) At each differentiation stage, HO cultures contain different types of cells, and sub-populations of each cell type can be in various stages of differentiation; which makes it very difficult to identify critical transcriptional changes through analyses performed on the bulk population. To deal with the cellular complexity within dynamically changing organoid cultures at different developmental stages, single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) can be used to simultaneously analyze global changes in the transcriptome of many individual cells.

1741. ‘Sertoli cell-only’ phenotype and single-cell RNA-seq define PRAMEF12 as a germline-specific factor for male stem cell maintenance and differentiation [scRNA-seq]
(Submitter supplied) Spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) have the dual capacity to self-renew and differentiate into progenitor spermatogonia that develop into mature spermatozoa. Here, we document that preferentially expressed antigen of melanoma family member 12 (PRAMEF12) is a key regulator of germline stem cell maintenance and differentiation. In male mice, genetic ablation of Pramef12 arrests spermatogenesis and results in sterility which can be rescued by transgenic expression of Pramef12. more...

Transcriptome analysis, at single cell level, demonstrates that proliferation and alterations in antigen presentation are associated with myeloma progression whereas NF-kB pathway activation has an anti-correlation. While these alterations are prominent in most of the extramedullary myeloma cells, some myeloma cells in the bone marrow show gene expression signatures resembling extramedullary cells even when the myeloma cells were taken at stable disease. more...

1758. Transcriptomics profiling of some commonly used cell lines at the base-line culture condition
(Submitter supplied) In vivo, melanoma cells transition though distinct phenotypic states in response to a changing microenvironment, and most notably can switch between invasive and proliferative phenotypes characterized by high and low levels of MITF activity (Hoek and Goding, 2010; Hoek et al., 2008). Since melanoma cell lines isolated from human tumors tend also to fall into either proliferative or invasive, slow-growing phenotypes (Hoek et al., 2006), it seems likely that established lines reflect specific phenotypic states within tumors, including those detected using single cell RNA-seq, that are then fixed and maintained under nutrient–rich culture conditions where the microenvironmental stresses encountered in vivo are absent. more...

1774. The in vivo endothelial cell translatome is highly heterogeneous across vascular beds (HUVEC RNAseq)
(Submitter supplied) The interspersed anatomic distribution of endothelial cells (ECs) and their dependence on microenvironmental cues have been major challenges in studying EC function and response to (patho)physiological stimuli in vivo. Combining EC-specific translating ribosome affinity purification (EC-TRAP) with RNA sequencing provides an accurate in vivo snapshot of tissue-specific EC expression profiles, and maintains a high degree of sensitivity to detect low abundant transcripts while limiting changes in gene expression profiles due to enzymatic tissue dissociation required to generate single cell suspensions for FACS sorting or single cell analysis. more...

1808. Functional analysis of the methyltransferase SMYD in the single-cell model organism Tetrahymena thermophila
(Submitter supplied) In order to resolve controversies concerning SMYD's substrates and functions, we studied SMYD1 (TTHERM_00578660), the only homologue in the unicellular eukaryote Tetrahymena thermophila. We epitope-tagged SMYD1, and analyzed its localization and interactome. We also characterized ΔSMYD1 cells, focusing on the replication and transcription phenotype. Our results show that: 1) SMYD1 is present in both cytoplasm and transcriptionally active macronucleus and shuttles between cytoplasm and macronucleus, which is consistent with its association with both histone and non-histone substrates; 2) SMYD1 is involved in DNA replication and regulates transcription of metabolism-related genes; 3) HSP90 is an potential substrate for SMYD1 and it may regulate target selection of HSP90, leading to pleiotropic effects in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus.

1839. Identification of a LIF-responsive replication-competent human β cell
(Submitter supplied) The beta (β) cell mass formed during embryogenesis is amplified by cell replication that occurs primarily during fetal and early postnatal development. Thereafter, β cells become functionally mature and their mass is maintained by a very low rate of replication.  For those few β cells that replicate in adult life, it is not known how replication is initiated, uncoupled from β cell function nor whether this occurs in a specialized subset of β cells. more...

(Submitter supplied) We profile the transcriptomes of over 100,000 human single cells, yielding molecular definitions for non-parenchymal cell types present in healthy and cirrhotic human liver. We uncover a novel scar-associated TREM2+CD9+ macrophage subpopulation, which expands in liver fibrosis, differentiates from circulating monocytes, has a corollary population in mouse liver fibrosis and is pro-fibrogenic. We also define novel ACKR1+ and PLVAP+ endothelial cells which expand in cirrhosis, are topographically scar-restricted and enhance leucocyte transmigration. more...

1872. RNA interactions are essential for proper CTCF function
(Submitter supplied) The function of the CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) in the organization of the genome has become an important area of investigation, but the mechanisms by which CTCF dynamically contributes to genome organization are not clear. We previously discovered that CTCF binds to large numbers of endogenous RNAs, promoting its self-association. In this regard, we now report two independent features that disrupt CTCF association with chromatin: inhibition of transcription and disruption of CTCF-RNA interactions through mutations of two of its 11 zinc fingers which are not required for CTCF binding to its cognate DNA site: zinc finger-1 (ZF1) or -10 (ZF10). more...

1905. A large pool of actively cycling progenitors orchestrates self-renewal and injury repair of an ectodermal appendage
(Submitter supplied) The classical model posits that a small number of quiescent stem cells (SCs) gives rise to proliferating transit-amplifying cells before terminal differentiation. However, recent evidence indicates that some tissues house multiple progenitor pools with distinct proliferative and differentiation potentials. Resolving the identity and spatial organization of these populations is therefore a fundamental requirement for understanding tissue renewal. more...

1918. CXCR5+PD-1+CD8+ T cells are a novel T helper cell sublineage and are negatively regulated by Stat5 [scRNA-Seq]
(Submitter supplied) Many autoimmune diseases are characterized by the production of autoantibodies. The current view is that CD4+ Tfh cells are the main subset regulating autoreactive B cells. Here, we discover a distinct novel CXCR5+PD1+ Tfh subset of CD8+ T cells whose development and function are negatively regulated by Stat5. These CD8+ Tfh cells regulate the GC B cell response and control autoantibody production. Deficiency of Stat5 in CD8+ T cells leads to an increase of CD8+ Tfh cells, resulting in the breakdown of B cell tolerance and autoantibody production. CD8+ Tfh share similar gene signatures with CD4+ Tfh and require CD40L/CD40 and TCR/MHCI interactions to deliver help to B cells. Our study highlights the diversity of follicular T cell subsets that contribute to the breakdown of B-cell tolerance

1939. TFPa/HADHA is required for fatty acid beta-oxidation and cardiolipin re-modeling in human cardiomyocytes
(Submitter supplied) Mitochondrial trifunctional protein deficiency, due to mutations in hydratase subunit A (HADHA), results in sudden infant death syndrome with no cure.  To reveal the disease etiology, we generated stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes from HADHA-deficient hiPSCs and accelerated their maturation via an engineered microRNA maturation cocktail that upregulated the epigenetic regulator, HOPX.  Here we report, matured HADHA mutant cardiomyocytes treated with an endogenous mixture of fatty acids manifest the disease phenotype: defective calcium dynamics and repolarization kinetics which results in a pro-arrhythmic state. more...

1941. A novel lymphoid-primed progenitor marked by Dach1 downregulation identified with single cell multi-omics
(Submitter supplied) A classical view of blood cell development is that multipotent haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) become lineage-restricted at defined stages. The Lin–c-kit+Sca1+Flt3+ stage, termed lymphoid-primed multipotent progenitors (LMPPs), have lost megakaryocyte and erythroid potential but are heterogeneous in their fate. Through single cell RNA-sequencing, we identify heterogeneous expression of Dach1 and associated genes in this fraction where it co-expressed with myeloid/stem genes but inversely correlated with lymphoid genes. more...

1958. Chronic cadmium exposure decreases the dependency of MCF7 breast cancer cells on ERα
(Submitter supplied) To understand how chronic cadmium exposure alters the dependency of ERα in terms of gene expression, we transiently silenced ERα using ICI, an antiestrogen that promotes the degradation of ERα. MCF7 and cadmium-adapted cells (Cd7 and Cd12) were treated with ICI to mediate the degradation of ERα, and a nonbiased global gene expression analysis was conducted using RNA-seq.  MCF7 shared 67.3% and 59.5% of the DE genes with Cd7 and Cd12 cells, respectively, suggesting that ERα continues to play an important role in regulating the expression of genes following chronic cadmium exposure. more...

We established an epidermal commitment model using human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) and characterized differentiation defects of PSCs carrying p63 mutations. Transcriptome analyses revealed distinct phases of epidermal commitment, multipotent simple epithelial, basal stratified epithelial and mature epidermal fates. more...

1970. Intestinal endocrine subtype specification analyzed by Single Cell RNA-Seq in mouse enteroids/mini-guts.
(Submitter supplied) The goal of this experiment is to decipher the mechanism of intestinal endocrine / enteroendocrine subtype specification, that is far from being fully understood. To this end, we used single cell genomics in mouse mini-guts. Enteroendocrine cells are derived from endocrine progenitors expressing the transcription factor Ngn3. We took advantage of the Ngn3+/eYFP mouse model -where endocrine progenitors and their descendants can be isolated and sorted by FACS on the basis of the eYFP fluorescence- and established enteroids or mini-guts from the small intestine. more...

How these opposing effects are integrated to impact immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) is unclear. We show that while inhibiting tumor IFNG signaling decreases interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in cancer cells, it increases ISGs in immune cells by enhancing IFNG produced by exhausted T cells (TEX). In tumors with favorable antigenicity, these TEX mediate rejection. more...

2004. Bulk (100cell) RNA-Sequencing of human fetal haematopoietic stem, progenitor and B cells
(Submitter supplied) Human lymphopoiesis is a dynamic life-long process that starts in utero at 6 weeks gestation; however developmental pathways defining fetal lymphopoiesis are largely unexplored. While the first committed B-progenitor in normal human bone marrow (BM) is a CD10+ve ProB-progenitor, the identification of a CD10-ve B-progenitor (Pre/ProB progenitor) in cord blood suggests there may be a second B-lymphoid development program in fetal life. more...

2037. The Position Beta57 of IAg7 Controls the Early Anti-Insulin Response and Onset of Diabetes in NOD mice to Link MHC and Disease [sequencing]
(Submitter supplied) Abstract- The class II region of the Major Histocompatibility locus is the main contributor to the genetic susceptibility to type 1 diabetes (T1D). The loss of an aspartic acid at position 57 of diabetogenic HLA-DQ8 chains supports this association; it influences the recognition of peptides in the context of HLA-DQ8, and I-Ag7 using a mechanism termed the P9 switch. Here, we built register-specific insulin MHC tetramers, Ins12-20 and Ins13-21, to examine anti-insulin CD4 T cell responses during the early pre-diabetic phase of disease in mice. more...

2038. C/EBPa mediates the growth inhibitory effect of progestins on breast cancer cells
(Submitter supplied) Steroid hormones are key gene regulators in breast cancer cells. While estrogens stimulate cell proliferation, progestins activate a single cell cycle followed by proliferation arrest. Here, we use biochemical and genome wide approaches to show that progestins achieve this effect via a functional crosstalk with C/EBPα. Using ChIP-seq, we identify around 1,000 sites where C/EBPα binding precedes and helps binding of Progesterone Receptor (PR) in response to hormone. more...

2039. RNA methylation maintains hematopoietic stem cell identity and symmetric commitment
(Submitter supplied) Stem cells balance cellular fates through asymmetric and symmetric divisions in order to self-renew or to generate downstream progenitors. Symmetric commitment divisions in stem cells are required for rapid regeneration during tissue damage and stress. The control of symmetric commitment remains poorly defined. N6-methyladenosine (m6A), the most abundant posttranscriptional mRNA modification controls cellular states and its abundance is dysregulated in cancer. more...

2043. GATA2 promotes hematopoietic development and represses cardiac differentiation of human mesoderm
(Submitter supplied)  In vertebrates, GATA2 is a master regulator of hematopoiesis and is expressed throughout embryo development and in adult life. Although the essential role of GATA2 in mouse hematopoiesis is well established, its involvement during early human hematopoietic development is not clear. By combining time-controlled overexpression of GATA2 with genetic knockout experiments, we found that GATA2, at the mesoderm specification stage, promotes the generation of hemogenic endothelial progenitors and their further differentiation to hematopoietic progenitor cells, and negatively regulates cardiac differentiation. more...

2072. Reconstituting the transcriptome and DNA methylome landscapes of human implantation 
(Submitter supplied) Implantation is a milestone event during mammalian embryogenesis. Implantation failure is a nonnegligible cause of human early pregnancy loss. Due to the extreme difficulty of obtaining in vivo human early post-implantation embryos, it remains elusive how the gene regulatory network and epigenetic mechanisms control human embryo implantation. Here, combining an in vitro culture system for human post-implantation development and single-cell omics sequencing technologies, over 8,000 individual cells from 65 human peri-implantation embryos were systematically analyzed. more...

2074. scSLAM-seq reveals core features of transcription dynamics in single cells
(Submitter supplied) Single cell RNA sequencing so far only depicts cellular transcriptomes at a single time point with low temporal resolution for kinetic changes. Here, we present a single-cell approach based on metabolic RNA labelling for combined sequencing of total and newly transcribed RNA as well as computational analysis of the RNA present prior to labelling. We apply it to cytomegalovirus infection of fibroblasts and reveal its potential for delineating alterations in transcriptional activity and decay in single cells under perturbed experimental conditions.

2075. GATA2 promotes hematopoietic development and represses cardiac differentiation of human mesoderm
(Submitter supplied) In vertebrates, GATA2 is a master regulator of hematopoiesis and is expressed throughout embryo development and in adult life. Although the essential role of GATA2 for the onset of mouse hematopoiesis is well established, its involvement during early human hematopoietic development is not clear. By combining time-controlled overexpression of GATA2 with genetic knockout experiments, we found that GATA2, at the mesoderm specification stage, promotes the generation of hemogenic progenitors and their further differentiation to hematopoietic progenitor cells, while negatively regulating cardiac differentiation. more...

2103. Single cell RNA-Seq data for Trp53/Brca1-null premalignant mammary epithelial cells and tumor cells with a K8+ luminal origin
(Submitter supplied) BRCA1 mutation-carriers are predisposed to develop Basal-like breast cancer (BLBC), and p53 mutations are present in the majority of human BLBC cases, suggesting loss of these two tumor suppressors play key roles in development of BLBC. Recent studies suggest that the majority of human breast cancers, including BLBC, may originate from mammary epithelial cells (MECs) in the luminal lineage. However, how loss of p53 and BRCA1 contributes to development of BLBC from luminal MECs remains largely elusive. more...

(Submitter supplied) Muscle is known to be a highly glycolytic tissue, yet the impact of glucose metabolism in muscle stem cell function remains unresolved. Here we use Mass Cytometry (CyTOF) to capture changes in histone acetylation profiles at the single cell level in vivo following injury. We demonstrate that MuSCs transiently increase histone acetylation upon activation, followed by global loss upon commitment. The switch to a committed state is driven by glucose metabolism through pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), which fuels histone acetylation via production of acetyl-CoA. more...

(Submitter supplied) Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E)–binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) inhibits cap-dependent translation in eukaryotes by competing with eIF4G for an interaction with eIF4E. Phos-phorylation at Ser-83 of 4E-BP1 occurs during mitosis through the activity of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1)/cyclin B rather than through canonical mTOR kinase activity. Here, we investi-gated the interaction of eIF4E with 4E-BP1 or eIF4G during interphase and mitosis. more...

2169. Mitofusins Regulate Lipid Metabolism to Mediate the Development of Lung Fibrosis
(Submitter supplied) Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating chronic lung disease, where lung function decline is gradual and the overall prognosis of patients with IPF is poor with a median survival after diagnosis of approximately 3.8 years. Growing evidence points to the fundamental role for the mitochondrion in alveolar type 2 (AEC2) cell dysfunction in the pathogenesis of IPF. Additionally, single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) recently identified MFN2 mRNA as significantly upregulated in AEC2 cells from patients with IPF, suggesting a role for mitochondrial fusion in AEC2 cells and the development of IPF. more...

2208. Lgr5+ stem and progenitor cells reside at the apex of a heterogeneous embryonic hepatoblast pool
(Submitter supplied) During mouse embryogenesis, progenitors within the liver known as hepatoblasts give rise to adult hepatocytes and cholangiocytes. Hepatoblasts, which are specified at E8.5-E9.0, have been regarded as a homogeneous progenitor population that initiate differentiation from E13.5. Recently, scRNA-seq analysis has identified sub- populations of transcriptionally distinct hepatoblasts at E11.5. Here, we show that hepatoblasts are not only transcriptionally but also functionally heterogeneous, and that a subpopulation of E9.5-E10.0 hepatoblasts exhibit a previously unidentified early commitment to cholangiocyte fate. more...

2236. Endothelial cell subtypes co-opt a TGFb/miR-30c-driven fibrinolytic pathway that supports tumor growth
(Submitter supplied) In tumors, extravascular fibrin forms provisional scaffolds for angiogenesis but is degraded by fibrinolysis and replaced with collagen in a process that resembles wound healing. We report that fibrin-mediated angiogenesis is inhibited and tumor growth is delayed following postnatal deletion of TGFβR2 in the endothelium (TGFβR2iECKO). TGFβR2iECKO endothelial cells (ECs) fail to up-regulate the fibrinolysis inhibitor Serpine1/PAI-1 due, in part, to uncoupled TGFβ-mediated suppression of miR-30c. more...

The skin pigment cells of vertebrates, derived from embryonic neural crest, are a useful system for elucidating mechanisms of fate specification, pattern formation, and how particular phenotypes impact organismal behavior and ecology. In a survey of Danio fishes, including zebrafish Danio rerio, we identified two populations of white pigment cells—leucophores—one of which arises by transdifferentiation of adult melanophores and another that develops from a yellow/orange xanthophore-like progenitor. more...

(Submitter supplied) Ontogeny describes the orchestrated assembly of a complex multicellular organism from a single totipotent zygote. As the embryo grows, proliferating cells become restricted in their fate to realize one of many encoded phenotypes, which are subsequently maintained through the combined action of cell-type specific transcription factors and broadly expressed regulatory machinery. Here, we provide a reference map of mouse development through gastrulation and early organogenesis, which can be used to explore the partitioning of early lineages and discrete cell states.

2270. Identification of a mesenchymal progenitor cell hierarchy in adipose tissue (scRNA-seq)
(Submitter supplied) The healthy growth of adipose tissue depends on the capacity of progenitor cells to undergo denovo adipogenesis. However, the cellular hierarchy and mechanisms governing adipocyteprogenitor differentiation are incompletely understood. Here, we identify a lineage hierarchy25 consisting of distinct mesenchymal cell types present in mouse and human adipose tissue. Cellsmarked by Dpp4 expression are highly proliferative, multipotent progenitors that give rise toIcam1+ committed pre-adipocytes and a related adipogenic population marked by Clec11a andCd142 expression. more...

2272. Single cell RNAseq of human TCRVdelta 1 and TCRVdelta 2 gammadelta T lymphocytes purified from healthy adults blood
(Submitter supplied) γδ T lymphocytes represent ~1% of human PBMC and even more cells in most tissues of vertebrates. Although they have important anticancer functions, most current scRNA-Seq studies do not identify γδ T lymphocytes since their transcriptomes at the single cell level are unknown. Here we show that high resolution clustering of large scRNA-Seq data sets and a combination of gene signatures allow the specific detection of human γδ T lymphocytes and identification of their TCRVδ1 and TCRVδ2 subsets in large data sets from complex cell mixtures. more...

(Submitter supplied) Oncogene induced senescence (OIS) is a tumour suppressive response to oncogene activation that can be transmitted to neighbouring cells through secreted factors of the senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Using single-cell transcriptomics we observed two distinct endpoints, a primary marked by Ras and a secondary by Notch. We find that secondary senescence in vitro and in vivo requires Notch, rather than SASP alone as previously thought. more...

(Submitter supplied) Elucidating the mechanism of reprogramming is confounded by heterogeneity due to the low efficiency and differential kinetics of obtaining induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from somatic cells. Therefore we increased the efficiency with a novel combination of epigenetic and signaling molecules and profiled the transcriptomes of individual reprogramming cells. Contrary to the established temporal order, somatic gene inactivation and upregulation of cell cycle, epithelial and early pluripotency genes can be triggered independently such that any combination of these events co-occurs in single cells. more...

However, it is unclear whether stem-like CD8 T cells require distinct transcriptional and epigenetic regulation for their longevity and adaptation to the immunosuppressive environment in chronic infection. Here, our comparison of single-cell transcriptomes and epigenetic profiles of CD8 T cells responding to acute and chronic viral infections revealed that stem-like CD8 T cells became distinct from memory precursors before clonal expansion ended. more...

(Submitter supplied) The perinatal period is a critical window for the distribution of innate tissue-resident immune cells to developing organs. Despite epidemiologic evidence implicating early life environment in risk for allergy, temporally controlled lineage-tracing of ILC2s during this period has not been done.  Using complementary fate-mapping approaches and fluorescent reporters of ILC2 activation, we demonstrate that ILC2s appear in multiple organs during late gestation similar to tissue macrophages, but unlike the latter, a majority of peripheral ILC2 pools are generated de novo during a postnatal window. more...

We found that while fibroblast number did not increase after injury, a population of activated fibroblasts can be identified in the fibrotic mouse lung. Using expression profiles of 1,945 lung fibroblasts we redefine the molecular characteristics of activated fibroblasts, finding that they are not a separate population but rather exhibit a similar, yet amplified, gene expression pattern to non-activated cells.

Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we identify the source of OSM to be a distinct subset of TREM2+ macrophages that predominate during early telogen. Moreover, inhibition of macrophages during telogen by genetic ablation, neutralizing antibodies and small-molecule inhibitors was sufficient to induce anagen.

Without HNF4s, cells fail to achieve a differentiated state. A positive feedback loop between HNF4 transcriptional regulation and BMP/SMAD signaling stabilizes differentiation, and the two inputs cooperatively activate differentiation gene expression.

2369. Adaptive plasticity of IL10+ and IL35+ regulatory T cells cooperatively promote intratumoral T cell exhaustion
(Submitter supplied) Abstract: Regulatory T cells (Tregs) maintain host self-tolerance but are a major barrier to effective cancer immunotherapy. Tregs subvert beneficial anti-tumor immunity by modulating inhibitory receptor (IR) expression on tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs); however, the underlying mediators and mechanisms remain elusive. Here we show that interleukin-10 (IL10) and interleukin-35 (IL35; a heterodimer of Ebi3 and IL12) are reciprocally expressed by Treg-subpopulations in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and cooperatively promote intratumoral T cell exhaustion. more...

2383. Acquisition of a hybrid E/M state is essential for tumorigenicity of basal breast cancer cells
(Submitter supplied) Using the recently described CD104+/CD44hi antigen combination we demonstrate that tumorigenicity depends on individual cells residing in a hybrid E/M state. Acquisition of this E/M hybrid state is facilitated by the differential expression of EMT- TFs, like Snail accompanied by the expression of adult stem-cell programs. Transition from the highly tumorigenic E/M state to a fully mesenchymal phenotype, achieved by constitutive ectopic expression of Zeb1, is sufficient to drive cells out of the E/M hybrid state into an extreme mesenchymal (xM) state, which is accompanied by a substantial loss of tumorigenicity and a switch from canonical to non-canonical Wnt signaling.

2431. Neural stem cells of Parkinson’s disease patients exhibit aberrant mitochondrial morphology and functionality
(Submitter supplied) Emerging evidence suggest that Parkinson's disease (PD), besides being an age-associated disorder, might also have a neurodevelopment component. Disruption of mitochondrial homeostasis has been highlighted as a crucial cofactor in its etiology. Here, we show that PD patient-specific human neuroepithelial stem cells (NESCs) carrying the LRRK2-G2019S mutation recapitulate key mitochondrial defects previously described only in differentiated dopaminergic neurons. more...

2432. Multiplexed Cas9 targeting reveals genomic location effects and gRNA-based staggered breaks influencing mutation efficiency and patterns
(Submitter supplied) Understanding the impact of guide RNA (gRNA) and genomic locus on CRISPR/Cas9 activity is crucial to design effective gene editing assays. However, it is challenging to profile Cas9 activity in the endogenous cellular environment. We leverage our TRIP technology to integrate ~1k barcoded reporter genes in the genomes of mouse embryonic stem cells. We target the integrated reporters (IRs) using RNA-guided Cas9 and characterize induced mutations by sequencing. more...

2433. Single-cell profiling of glomerular cells provides a dynamic picture in experimental diabetic kidney disease
(Submitter supplied) Background: Recent single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analyses have offered much insight into cell-specific gene expression profiles in normal kidneys. However, in diseased kidneys, understanding of changes in specific cells, particularly glomerular cells, remains limited. Methods: To elucidate the glomerular cell–specific gene expression changes in diabetic kidney disease, we performed scRNA-seq analysis of isolated glomerular cells from streptozotocin-induced diabetic endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS)–deficient (eNOS-/-) mice and control eNOS-/- mice. more...

2434. Single-cell analysis of homeostatic and regenerative adult skeletal muscle stem cells
(Submitter supplied) Skeletal muscle stem cells (MuSCs) ensure the formation and homeostasis of skeletal muscle and are responsible for its growth and repair processes. For repair to occur, MuSCs must exit from quiescence, abandon their niche and asymmetrically and symmetrically divide to reconstitute the stem cell pool and give rise to muscle progenitors, respectively. The transcriptomes of pooled MuSCs have provided a rich source of information for describing the genetic programs underlying distinct static cell states; however, bulk microarray and RNA-seq afford only averaged gene expression profiles, which blur the heterogeneity and developmental dynamics of asynchronous MuSC populations. more...

Here, we show how treatment-induced changes occur in multiple tumor compartments during tumor relapse and can reduce benefit of follow-on therapies. By utilizing serial biopsies, next generation sequencing and single cell transcriptomics, we tracked the evolution of multiple cellular compartments within individual lesions during first-line treatment response, relapse and second-line therapeutic interventions in an autochthonous model of melanoma. more...

While effective genetic approaches have been developed in vitro and in animal models, these cannot be used to interrogate human physiology in vivo. Instead, naturally occurring somatic mutations have been utilized to infer clonality and lineal relationships between cells in human tissues, but current approaches are limited by high error rates and scale, and provide little information about the state or function of the cells. more...

2465. Single-Cell Transcriptomes of the Regenerating Intestine Reveal a Revival Stem Cell [part 1]
(Submitter supplied) The weekly turnover of the intestinal epithelium is driven by multipotent, Lgr5+, crypt base columnar cells (CBCs). In response to injury, however, Lgr5+ cells are lost but then re-emerge and are required for successful recovery. How these resurgent Lgr5+ stem cells arise is unclear. We transcriptionally profiled single cells from regenerating intestinal epithelia and identified a unique cell type we term the revival stem cell (rSC). more...

We combined single-cell RNA sequencing and genotyping to profile 38,410 cells from 40 bone marrow aspirates, including 16 AML patients and five healthy donors. We then applied a machine learning classifier to distinguish a spectrum of malignant cell types whose abundances varied between patients and between subclones in the same tumor. more...

2484. Transcriptomic Profiling of Circulating Tumor Cells in Multiple Myeloma: A New Model to Understand Disease Dissemination III
(Submitter supplied) The number of peripheral blood (PB) circulating tumor cells (CTCs) predicts risk of transformation in smoldering multiple myeloma (MM) and survival in active MM. Growing evidence suggests that as the tumor progresses and the microenvironment becomes hypoxic, clonal plasma cells (PCs) constantly invade new regions of the bone marrow (BM) through induced systemic recirculation. Of note, the frequency of CTCs is typically low and thus, it could be hypothesized that the dissemination of MM is made by few tumor cells with unique features that induce them to egress the BM and spread the disease through PB. more...

(Submitter supplied) Plexiform neurofibroma is a major contributor to morbidity in Neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) patients. Macrophages and mast cells infiltrate neurofibroma, and data from mouse models implicate these leukocytes in neurofibroma development. Anti-inflammatory therapy targeting these cell populations has been suggested as a means to prevent neurofibroma development. Here, we compare gene expression in inflamed nerves from NF1 models which invariably form neurofibroma to those with inflammation driven by EGFR overexpression which rarely progresses to neurofibroma. more...

2497. Chromatin mapping and single-cell immune profiling defines the temporal dynamics of ibrutinib drug response in chronic lymphocytic leukemia
(Submitter supplied) Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a genetically, epigenetically, and clinically heterogeneous disease. Despite this heterogeneity, the Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor ibrutinib provides effective treatment for the vast majority of CLL patients. To define the underlining regulatory program, we analyzed high-resolution time courses of ibrutinib treatment in closely monitored patients, combining cellular phenotyping (flow cytometry), single-cell transcriptome profiling (scRNA-seq), and chromatin mapping (ATAC-seq). more...

(Submitter supplied) We report the use of high-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to analyze gene expression in wild-type and mutant Arabidopsis root cells.  We demonstrate that using a commercially available platform for droplet-based scRNA-seq (10X Genomics Chromium) enables transcriptional profiling of individual protoplasts representing all of the major cell/tissue types of the root.  Furthermore, rare cell types and subtypes have been identified.  These single-cell transcriptomes were also used to generate a pseudotime series for the root hair and non-hair cell differentiation pathways.  In addition, scRNA-seq was used to define and compare transcriptomes from root epidermis mutants, which enabled a detailed molecular analysis of the mutant phenotype.  This study demonstrates the feasibility and usefulness of scRNA-seq in plants and provides a gene expression map at single-cell resolution for the Arabidopsis root.

2568. Nephron progenitor commitment is a stochastic process influenced by cell migration.
(Submitter supplied) Kidney development depends on a balance of nephron progenitor self-renewal and commitment. Here we examine how cells shift from a motile progenitor state to a static committed state during nephrogenesis. Cells that express Wnt4, an early marker of commitment, give rise to both the nephron lineage and a migrating sub-population that may re-enter the progenitor pool. Single cell transcriptional profiling reveals Wnt4-lineage cells across a range of transcriptional states, including cells that return to an uninduced progenitor state.

2579. Single-cell profiling of the myeloid landscape identifies cell subsets with distinct fates during neuroinflammation
(Submitter supplied) The innate immune cell compartment is highly diverse in the healthy central nervous system (CNS) including parenchymal and non-parenchymal macrophages. However, this complexity is increased in inflammatory settings by the recruitment of circulating myeloid cells. It is unclear which disease-specific myeloid subsets exist and what their transcriptional profiles and dynamics during CNS pathology are. By combining deep single-cell transcriptome analysis, fate mapping, in vivo imaging, clonal analysis, and transgenic lines, we comprehensively characterized unappreciated myeloid subsets in several CNS compartments during neuroinflammation. During inflammation, CNS macrophage subsets undergo self-renewal, and random proliferation shifted towards clonal expansion. Finally, functional studies demonstrated that endogenous CNS tissue macrophages are redundant for antigen presentation. Our results highlight myeloid cell diversity and provide insights into the brain’s innate immune system.

2598. Single cell transcriptomic analysis of the lateral hypothalamic area reveals molecularly distinct populations of inhibitory and excitatory neurons
(Submitter supplied) We employed a droplet-based single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) approach to develop a comprehensive census of molecularly distinct cell types in the mouse lateral hypothalamic area (LHA). In addition to 13 distinct non-neuronal cell populations, we define 15 distinct populations of glutamatergic and 15 distinct populations of GABAergic neurons, including both known and novel cell types. This comprehensive transcriptomic analysis of LHA cell types lays the groundwork for understanding the circuit-level underpinnings of LHA coordination of innate behavior.

2599. Oligodendrocyte progenitor cells become regionally diverse and heterogeneous with age
(Submitter supplied) Oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), which differentiate into myelinating oligodendrocytes during central nervous system (CNS) development, are the main proliferative cells in the adult brain. OPCs are conventionally considered a homogeneous population, particularly with respect to their electrophysiological properties, but this has been debated. We show, by using single-cell electrophysiological recordings, that OPCs start out as a homogeneous population, but become functionally heterogeneous, varying both within and between brain regions and with age. more...

(Submitter supplied) We report that the Drosophila Non-Specific Lethal (NSL) complex is necessary to maintain this stereotypical nucleosomal organization at promoters. Upon NSL1 depletion, nucleosomes invade the NDRs at TSSs of NSL-bound genes. NSL complex member NSL3 binds to TATA-less promoters in a sequence-dependent manner.  We showed that the NSL complex is necessary and sufficient to recruit NURF chromatin remodeling complex to target promoters. more...

Here we describe an informatics tool (PyMINEr) that fully automates cell type identification, cell type-specific pathway analyses, graph theory-based analysis of gene regulation, and detection of autocrine/paracrine signaling networks in silico. We applied PyMINEr to interrogate human pancreatic islet scRNAseq datasets and discovered several features of co-expression graphs including: concordance of scRNAseq-graph structure with both protein-protein interactions and 3D-genomic architecture; association of high connectivity and low expression genes with cell type-enrichment; and potential for graph-structure to clarify potential etiologies of enigmatic disease-associated variants. more...

2604. Circulating Tumor Cells Clustering Triggers DNA Methylation Changes to Enable Metastasis Seeding
(Submitter supplied) The ability of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) to form clusters has been linked to increased metastatic potential. Yet biological features and vulnerabilities of CTC clusters remain largely unknown. Our DNA methylation analysis led us to hypothesize that CTC clusters are characterized by active TF networks that support both stemness and proliferation. To identify whether the stemness- and proliferation-related TF networks are also transcriptionally active in CTC clusters compared to single CTCs, we performed single-cell resolution RNA sequencing analysis of single CTCs and CTC clusters, matched within individual liquid biopsies and isolated from six breast cancer patients with progressive metastatic disease, and of single CTCs and CTC clusters isolated from three xenograft models. more...

2673. A novel computational complete deconvolution method using RNA-seq data
(Submitter supplied) The cell type composition of many biological tissues varies widely across samples. Such sample heterogeneity hampers efforts to probe the role of each cell type in the tissue microenvironment. Current approaches that address this issue have drawbacks. Cell sorting or single-cell based experimental techniques disrupt in situ interactions and alter physiological status of cells in tissues. Computational methods are flexible and promising; but they often estimate either sample-specific proportions of each cell type or cell-type-specific gene expression profiles, not both, by requiring the other as input. more...

2681. From pioneer to repressor: Bimodal foxd3 activity dynamically remodels neural crest regulatory landscape in vivo
(Submitter supplied) The neural crest (NC) is a transient embryonic stem cell population characterised by its multipotency and broad developmental potential. Here, we perform NC-specific transcriptional and epigenomic profiling of foxd3-mutant versus wild-type cells in vivo to define the gene regulatory circuits controlling NC specification. Together with global binding analysis obtained by foxd3 biotin-ChIP and single cell profiles of foxd3-expressing premigratory NC, our analysis shows that during early steps of NC formation, foxd3 acts globally as a pioneer factor to prime the onset of genes regulating NC specification and migration by re-arranging the chromatin landscape, opening cis-regulatory elements and reshuffling nucleosomes. more...

2692. Aging alters the epigenetic asymmetry of HSC division [scRNA-Seq]
(Submitter supplied) Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) balance self-renewal and differentiation to maintain homeostasis. With aging, the  frequency of polar HSCs decreases. Cell polarity in HSCs is controlled by the activity of the small RhoGTPase Cdc42. Here  we demonstrate, using a comprehensive set of paired daughter cell analyses that include single cell 3D-confocal imaging,  single cell transplants, single cell RNA-seq as well as single cell ATAC-seq, that the outcome of HSC divisions is strongly  linked to the polarity status before mitosis, which is in turn determined by the level of the activity Cdc42 in stem cells. more...

The genetic program driving human HSPC emergence remains largely unknown. We previously reported that the generation of hemogenic precursor cells from mouse fibroblasts recapitulates developmental hematopoiesis. Here, we demonstrate that human fibroblasts can be reprogrammed into hemogenic cells by the same transcription factors. more...

(Submitter supplied) Loss of sensory hair cells leads to deafness and balance deficiencies. In contrast to mammalian hair cells, zebrafish ear and lateral line hair cells regenerate from poorly characterized, proliferating support cells. Equally ill-defined is the gene regulatory network underlying the progression of support cells to cycling hair cell progenitors and differentiated hair cells. We used single-cell RNA-Sequencing (scRNA-Seq) of lateral line sensory organs and uncovered five different support cell types, including quiescent and activated stem cells. more...

(Submitter supplied) Endothelial dysfunction promotes the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy (DN), which is considered to be an early event in disease progression. However, the molecular changes associated with glomerular endothelial cell (GEC) injury in early DN are not well defined. Most gene expression studies have relied on the indirect assessment of GEC injury from isolated glomeruli or renal cortices. Here, we present transcriptomic analysis of isolated GECs, using streptozotocin-induced diabetic wildtype (STZ-WT) and diabetic eNOS-null (STZ-eNOS−/−) mice as models of mild and advanced DN, respectively. more...

(Submitter supplied) Insulin gene mutations are a leading cause of neonatal diabetes. They can lead to proinsulin misfolding and its retention in endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This results in increased ER-stress suggested to trigger beta-cell apoptosis. In humans, the mechanisms underlying beta-cell failure remain unclear. Here we show that misfolded proinsulin impairs developing beta-cell proliferation without increasing apoptosis. more...

Technical challenges in isolation of GFRα1+ versus GFRα1- undifferentiated spermatogonia have precluded the comparative molecular characterization of these subpopulations and their functional evaluation as stem cells. Here, we develop a method to purify these subpopulations by FACS and show that GFRα1+ and GFRα1- undifferentiated spermatogonia both demonstrate elevated transplantation activity while differing principally in receptor tyrosine kinase signaling and cell cycle. more...

2706. Acc1 determines memory potential of individual CD4+ T cells by regulating de novo fatty acid biosynthesis [RNA-seq]
(Submitter supplied) Immunological memory is central to adaptive immunity and protection from disease. Changing metabolic demands as antigen-specific T cells transition from effector to memory have been well documented, but the cell-specific pathways and molecules that govern this transition are poorly defined. ACC1 is a rate-limiting enzym in fatty acid biosynthesis. We show that genetic deletion of ACC1 enhanced the formation of CD4+ T cell memory, and that inhibition of ACC1 function enhanced memory T cell formation during parasite infection in mice. more...

Most Tub-A treated oocytes were arrested in an MI-like or a GVBD-like stage and decreased mTOR (spindle formation factor) and mDia1 (inhibitor of actin assembly) in an HDAC6 expression-dependent manner. We wonder if TubA only affects HDAC6 expression. more...

This cellular mosaicism leads to phenotypic variability and poses significant challenges for interpreting the effects of X-linked mutant alleles on gene expression. We present a single-nucleus RNA sequencing approach that resolves mosaicism by using single nucleotide polymorphisms in genes that are expressed in cis with the X-linked mutation to determine whether individual nuclei express the wild-type or mutant allele even when the mutant gene is not directly detected. more...

2760. Molecular and functional heterogeneity of IL-10-producing CD4+ T cells [Mouse SMART-seq2]
(Submitter supplied) IL-10 is a prototypical anti-inflammatory cytokine, which is fundamental to the maintenance of immune homeostasis, especially in the intestine. There is an assumption that cells producing IL-10 have an immunoregulatory function. However, here we report that IL-10-producing CD4+ T cells are phenotypically and functionally heterogeneous. By combining single cell transcriptome and functional analyses, we identified a subpopulation of IL-10-producing Foxp3Neg CD4+ T cells that displays regulatory activity unlike other IL-10-producing CD4+ T cells, which are unexpectedly pro-inflammatory. more...

(Submitter supplied) We analyzed single cell transcriptomes over 80,000 cells isolated from 65 organoids differentiated from iPSCs and ESCs using two different protocols. We find that both protocols generate kidney organoids that contain a diverse range of kidney cells at differing ratios as well as non-renal cell types. We reconstructed lineage relationships during organoid differentiation through pseudotemporal ordering, and identified transcription factor networks associated with fate decisions. more...

2825. Transcriptomic but not genomic variability confers phenotype of breast cancer stem cells
(Submitter supplied) Background: Breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) are considered responsible for cancer relapse and drug-resistance. Understanding the identity of BCSCs may open new avenues in breast cancer therapy. Although several discoveries have been made on BCSCs characterization, the factors critical to BCSCs is largely unclear. This study was aimed to determine whether genomic mutation contributes to the acquisition of cancer stem-like phenotype, and to investigate the genetic and transcriptional features of BCSCs. more...

(Submitter supplied) A specific subpopulation of neural progenitor cells, the basal radial glia cells (bRGCs) of the outer subventricular zone (OSVZ), are thought to have a key role in the evolutionary expansion of mammalian neocortex. In the developing lissencephalic mouse neocortex, bRGCs exist at low abundance and show significant molecular differences from bRGCs in developing gyrencephalic species. Here, we demonstrate that developing mouse medial neocortex, in contrast to the canonically studied lateral neocortex, exhibits an OSVZ and an abundance of bRGCs similar to that in developing gyrencephalic neocortex. more...

(Submitter supplied) Here we report that exogenous IL-1β induces TBK1-mediated interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) activation and autophagic flux in human myeloid and epithelial cells. IL-1β-induced innate immune activation is dependent upon the DNA sensing pathway adaptor, stimulator of interferon genes (STING), through the recognition of mitochondrial DNA by cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS). Thus, IL-1β potentiates pathogen-induced interferon production and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling to amplify innate immune responses.

(Submitter supplied) Targeting autophagy in cancer cells and in the tumor microenvironment are current goals of cancer therapy. However, components of canonical autophagy play roles in other biological processes, adding complexity to this goal. One such alternative function of autophagy proteins is LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP), which functions in phagosome maturation and subsequent signaling events. Here we show that impairment of LAP in the myeloid compartment, rather than canonical autophagy, induces control of tumor growth by tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) upon phagocytosis of dying tumor cells. more...

(Submitter supplied) Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) methods generate sparse gene expression profiles for thousands of single cells in a single experiment. The information in these profiles is sufficient to classify cell types by distinct expression patterns but the high complexity of scRNA-seq libraries prevents full characterization of transcriptomes from individual cells. To generate more focused gene expression information from scRNA-seq libraries, we developed a strategy to physically recover the DNA molecules comprising transcriptome subsets, enabling deeper interrogation of the isolated molecules by another round of DNA sequencing. more...

We identify the upregulation of STRAP in hepatocellular carcinomas. Elevated STRAP endows tumor cells with growth advantage by reprograming a variety of metabolic processes and signaling pathways critical for hepatocellular carcinoma progression. Especially, enhanced Wnt/β-catenin signaling is likely to be a major effector of its tumor-promoting role.

2921. Expression data of endothelium and hematopoietic cluster cells in the wild type and Steel mutant E11.5 AGM and vitelline and umbilical arteries
(Submitter supplied) Kit ligand (Kitl, aka SCF) is a pivotal cytokine in fetal liver and bone marrow hematopoiesis. Its role in pre-liver embryonic hematopoiesis, however, is less well understood. We investigated the hematopoietic phenotype of Steel (Sl/Sl) mutant embryos, which lack Kitl, and found that the normal development of the HSC lineage in the aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region is negatively affected. We isolated endothelium and hematopoietic cluster cells from wild type and Sl/Sl AGM and vitelline and umbilical arteries for expression analysis by RNA-seq to investigate molecular changes in the developing HSC lineage and endothelial cells in the aortic HSC niche.

2923. SIS-seq, a molecular ‘time machine’, connects single cell fate with gene programs
(Submitter supplied) Conventional single cell RNA-seq methods are destructive, such that a given cell cannot also then be tested for fate and function, without a time machine. Here, we develop a clonal method SIS-seq, whereby single cells are allowed to divide, and progeny cells are assayed separately in SISter conditions; some for fate, others by RNA-seq. By cross-correlating fate and gene expression within a clone, and doing this for many clones, we can identify the earliest gene expression signatures of dendritic cell subset development. more...

The oligopotent Granulocyte Monocyte Progenitors (GMP) in the bone marrow give rise to monocytes and all granulocytes. Although several monocyte progenitors have been identified in mouse bone marrow, the unipotent neutrophil progenitors are still not well-defined. Here, we use Cytometry by Time-of-Flight (CyTOF) and Single-cell RNA-Sequencing (scRNA-Seq) methodologies to identify a committed unipotent early-stage neutrophil progenitor in adult mouse bone marrow. more...

This process depends on their capacity to express promiscuously genes encoding tissue-restricted antigens. This competence is accomplished in medullary TEC (mTEC) in part by the presence of the transcriptional facilitator AutoImmune REgulator, AIRE. AIRE-regulated gene transcription is marked by repressive chromatin modifications, including H3K27me3. more...

(Submitter supplied) A number of autoimmunity-associated MHC class II proteins interact only weakly with the invariant chain-derived class II-associated invariant chain peptide (CLIP).  CLIP dissociates rapidly from I-Ag7 even in the absence of DM, and this property is related to the type 1 diabetes-associated b57 polymorphism.  We generated knock-in Non-obese Diabetic (NOD) mice with a single amino acid change in the CLIP segment of invariant chain in order to moderately slow CLIP dissociation from I-Ag7. more...

3053. Spec-seq unveils transcriptional subpopulations of antibody-secreting cells following influenza vaccination
(Submitter supplied) Vaccines are among the most effective public health tools for combating certain infectious diseases such as influenza. The role of the humoral immune system in vaccine-induced protection is widely appreciated; however, our understanding of how antibody specificities relate to B cell function remains limited, due to the complexity of polyclonal antibody responses. To address this, we developed the Spec-seq framework, which allows for simultaneous monoclonal antibody (mAb) characterization and transcriptional profiling from the same single cell. more...

(Submitter supplied) Chromatin regulators play a broad role in regulating gene expression, and when gone awry, can lead to cancer. Here we demonstrate that ablation of the histone demethylase LSD1 in cancer cells increases repetitive element expression, including ERVs, and decreases expression of RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) components. Significantly, this leads to dsRNA stress and activation of type 1 interferon, which stimulates anti-tumor T cell immunity and restrains tumor growth. more...

3084. Differences in cell cycle status underlie transcriptional heterogeneity in the HSC compartment
(Submitter supplied) Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are considered a heterogeneous cell population. In an attempt to further resolve the HSC compartment, we characterized a retinoic acid (RA) reporter mouse line. Sub-fractionation of the HSC compartment in RA-CFP reporter mice demonstrated that RA-CFP-dim HSCs were largely non-proliferative and displayed superior engraftment potential in comparison to RA-CFP-bright HSCs. Gene expression analysis demonstrated higher expression of RA-target genes in RA-CFP-dim HSCs, contrasting the RA-CFP reporter expression, but both RA-CFP-dim and –bright HSCs responded efficiently to ATRA in vitro. more...

(Submitter supplied) Kidney transplantation offers the best survival and quality of life for patients’ with end-stage kidney disease. The major barrier to successful long-term transplantation is the host’s immune response to alloantigens’ causing rejection of the transplant. The complexity of this immune response in kidney transplantation is still not fully understood and effective treatment strategies are needed. To better understand rejection at the molecular and cellular level we characterized 4,487 cells from a single biopsy core from a kidney transplant undergoing mixed rejection using single cell RNA sequencing.

3115. Histone Variant H2A.Z Defines Cell Identity in Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells as Revealed by Single-Cell Transcriptomics
(Submitter supplied) We applied single-cell RNA-Seq to analyze human diseased arteries, and identified histone variant H2A.Z as a key histone signature to maintain vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) identity. We show that H2A.Z occupies genomic regions near VSMC marker genes and its occupancy is decreased in VSMC undergoing dedifferentiation. Mechanistically, H2A.Z occupancy preferentially promotes nucleosome turnover, facilitates the recruitment of Smad3 and Med1 to VSMC marker genes, thereby activating gene expression. more...

3117. Dissection of influenza infection in vivo by single-cell RNA-sequencing
(Submitter supplied) The influenza virus is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, yet, the impact of intracellular viral invasion and the cellular response diversity remain uncharacterized. By massively parallel single-cell RNA-seq we comprehensively mapped the host lung response to in-vivo influenza infection in wild-type and Irf7-knockout mice across nine immune and non-immune cell types. We found an unexpected high prevalence of infected cells in all cell types, showed that infection is a characteristic property of cell types that is independent of type-I interferon activity, and demonstrated that all cell types responded primarily with a robust generic transcriptional response. more...

We discovered that addition of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) during the differentiation process resulted in an approximately ten-fold increase in endothelial cells, without compromising the formation of the organoids. more...

3181. Cell type atlas and lineage tree of a whole complex animal by single-cell transcriptomics
(Submitter supplied) Flatworms of the species Schmidtea mediterranea are immortal –adult animals contain a large pool of pluripotent stem cells that continuously differentiate to all adult cell types. Therefore, single-cell transcriptome profiling of adult animals should reveal mature and progenitor cells. Here, by combining perturbation experiments, gene expression analysis, a computational method that predicts future cell states from the transcriptional changes, and a novel lineage reconstruction method, we placed all major cell types onto a single lineage tree that connects all cells to a single stem cell compartment. more...

3183. Single-cell sequencing of stage 4 chicken embryos
(Submitter supplied) Abstract from Vermillion et al: During vertebrate development, progenitor cells give rise to tissues and organs through a complex choreography that commences at gastrulation. A hallmark event of gastrulation is the formation of the primitive streak, a linear assembly of cells along the anterior-posterior (AP) axis of the developing organism. To examine the primitive streak at a single-cell resolution, we measured the transcriptomes of individual chick cells from the streak or the surrounding tissue (the rest of the area pellucida) in Hamburger-Hamilton stage 4 embryos. more...

Multiple diseases have been linked to alterations in PC function. Past studies of PCs have relied on in vivo models, and limited in vitro models, including organoids. While useful, whether the in vitro models recapitulate in vivo biology is an important, yet unanswered question. more...

3215. Quiescent tissue stem cells evade immune surveillance
(Submitter supplied) Stem cells are critical for the maintenance of many tissues, and thus their integrity is crucial, but whether this integrity is maintained in the face of an immune response is not well defined. Here we set out to determine the outcome of T cell interactions with adult stem cells in their physiological niche. We find that fast cycling epithelial stem cells, including Lgr5+ intestinal stem cells, as well as ovary and mammary stem cells, are eliminated by activated T-cells, but slow cycling stem cells, specifically hair follicle and muscle stem cells, are resistant to T-cell killing. more...

(Submitter supplied) Increasing evidence indicates that minor subpopulations intrinsic to androgen-independence are present in prostate cancer cells, poised to become clonal dominance under prolonged androgen-deprivation selection. To stratify different subpopulations, we conduct transcriptome profiling of 144 single LNCaP prostate cancer cells treated and untreated with androgen after cell cycle synchronization. At least eight subpopulations of LNCaP cells are identified, revealing a previously unappreciable level of cellular heterogeneity to androgen stimulation. more...

3252. Parkinson’s Disease Genetic Risk in a Midbrain Neuronal Cell Line
(Submitter supplied) In genome-wide association studies of complex diseases, many risk polymorphisms are found to lie in non-coding DNA and likely confer risk through allele-dependent differences in gene regulatory elements. However, because distal regulatory elements can alter gene expression at various distances on linear DNA, the identity of relevant genes is unknown for most risk loci. In Parkinson’s disease, at least some genetic risk is likely intrinsic to a neuronal subpopulation of cells in the brain regions affected. more...

(Submitter supplied) Primary infection with human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) results in a lifelong infection due to its ability to establish latent infection, with one characterized viral reservoir being hematopoietic cells. Although reactivation from latency causes serious disease in immunocompromised individuals, our molecular understanding of latency is limited. Here, we delineate viral gene expression during natural HCMV persistent infection by analyzing the massive transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) atlas generated by the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. more...

(Submitter supplied) CD4+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CD4-CTLs) have been reported to play a protective role in several viral infections. However, little is known in humans about the biology of CD4-CTL generation, their functional properties, heterogeneity and clonal diversity, especially in relation to other well-described CD4+ memory T cell subsets. We performed single-cell RNA-seq in over 9000 cells to unravel CD4-CTL heterogeneity, transcriptional profile and clonality in humans. more...

3316. Massively Parallel Single Nucleus Transcriptional Profiling Defines Spinal Cord Cell Types and Their Activity During Behavior
(Submitter supplied) To understand the cellular basis of behavior, it is necessary to know the types of cells that exist in the nervous system and their contributions to function. Spinal cord networks are essential for sensory processing and motor behavior; however, the cellular correlates of these functions are not well understood. Here, we developed a massively parallel single nucleus RNA sequencing technique to first create a cell type atlas of the adult mouse spinal cord and then to use the transcriptional signatures of neuronal activity to map the cell types associated with specific behaviors. more...

Here we show that mtDNA mutations are present in primordial germ cells (PGCs) within healthy female human embryos. Close scrutiny revealed the signature of selection against non-synonymous variants in the protein-coding region, tRNA gene variants, and variants in specific regions of the non-coding D-loop. more...

These responses are highly important for neuron growth cone guidance, synapse formation, and regeneration following injury. Because an altered spatial distribution of mRNA can result in mental retardation or neurodegenerative diseases, subcellular transcriptome analysis of neurons could be a useful tool for studying these conditions, but current techniques, such as in situ hybridization, bulk microarray, or RNA-Seq, impose tradeoffs between spatial resolution and multiplexing. more...

However, because fate in hematopoiesis has mostly been studied in the context of transplantation, it is unclear whether these lineage branches and such proposed oligopotent progenitors exist in an unperturbed hematopoietic system. Here, we utilize endogenous transposon tagging to trace the fate of thousands of progenitors and stem cells over time to re-evaluate these dogmas. more...

3347. Tumor-associated macrophages derived from circulating inflammatory monocytes degrade collagen through cellular uptake
(Submitter supplied) Physiologic turnover of interstitial collagen is mediated by a sequential pathway, in which collagen is fragmented by pericellular collagenases, endocytosed by specific collagen receptors, and routed to lysosomes for degradation by lysosomal cathepsins. Here, we used intravital microscopy to investigate if malignant tumors, which are characterized by high rates of extracellular matrix turnover, utilize a similar collagen degradation pathway. more...

3349. Authentic single cell RNA-Seq by measuring the transcriptome of an individual cell twice
(Submitter supplied) We developed a novel single-cell RNA-Seq technique that can directly measure the technical noises for each individual gene by splitting a single cell into two equal halves and measuring their transcriptomes separately (Measure a single cell twice by RNA-Seq, MAST-Seq).The MAST-Seq protocol was developed from the single cell RNA-Seq technique we previously developed (Tang et al. 2010). We first lysated the cell to release the RNA from the cell, then reverse transcripted the mRNA into cDNA, added polyA to the 3' end of cDNA, synthesized the second strand of cDNA used designed primer, and at last PCR amplified the double strand cDNA to get enough amount of DNA to construct the cDNA libraries.

However, the cellular processes that contribute to neuronal subtype specification and transcriptional heterogeneity remain unclear. By comparing the gene expression profiles of a subset of single layer 6 corticothalamic neurons in somatosensory cortex, we show that transcriptional subtypes primarily reflect axonal projection pattern, laminar position within the cortex, and neuronal activity state. more...

However, the underlying mechanisms and location for generating such innate memory responses in vivo remains unknown. Here we show that access of Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) to the bone marrow (BM) changes the transcriptional landscape of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and multipotent progenitors (MPP) leading to local cell expansion and enhanced myelopoiesis at the expense of lymphopoiesis. more...

(Submitter supplied) Granulocyte-monocyte progenitors (GMPs) and monocyte-dendritic cell progenitors (MDPs) produce monocytes during homeostasis and in response to increased demand during infection. Both progenitor populations are thought to derive from common myeloid progenitors (CMPs), and a hierarchical relationship (CMP-GMP-MDP-monocyte) is presumed to underlie monocyte differentiation. Here, however, we demonstrate that mouse MDPs arose from CMPs independently of GMPs, and that GMPs and MDPs produced monocytes via similar, but distinct, monocyte-committed progenitors. more...

3411. Large-scale low-cost NGS library preparation using a robust Tn5 purification and tagmentation protocol [i5i7]
(Submitter supplied) In recent years, tagmentation-based library preparation using a hyperactive version of the Tn5 transposase gained more and more popularity. The limited hands-on time, robustness and high efficiency of the method are essential for the processing of next-generation sequencing libraries from little input material like single cells or the processing of hundreds of samples simultaneously. The hyperactive Tn5 is commercially available (Nextera XT DNA library preparation kit), however, high-throughput experiments with hundreds of samples are costly. more...

Here, Greer et al. demonstrate that Ubqln1 is required for BCR-driven B cell proliferation through maintenance of protein synthesis following stimulation. In the absence of Ubqln1, mitochondrial proteins accumulate in the cytosol, which may account for the observed proteostasis. BCR stimulation of murine B cells induced a long-lasting mitochondrial depolarization that did not occur in response to LPS. more...

(Submitter supplied) In mammals during the early postnatal period the environment plays a critical role in promoting the final steps in neuronal development. While epigenetic factors are thought to contribute to this process, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we show that in the brain during early life the DNA methyltransferase DNMT3A transiently binds across transcribed regions of lowly expressed genes, and its binding specifies the pattern of DNA methylation at CA sequences (mCA) within these genes. more...

3444. Single cell RNA Seq data of BMDM from mouse infected with Salmonella [full time course]
(Submitter supplied) The interaction between a pathogen and a host is a highly dynamic process in which both agents activate complex programs. Here, we introduce a single-cell RNA-Seq method (scDual-Seq) that simultaneously captures both host and pathogen transcriptomes and use it to study the process of infection of individual mouse macrophages with the intracellular pathogen Salmonella typhimurium. Among the infected macrophages, we found three subpopulations and we show evidence for a linear progression through these subpopulations, supporting a model in which these three states correspond to consecutive stages of infection.

3478. Transcriptomic profiles of CD4+ T lymphocytes from RhoA wild type (WT) and RhoA G17V mice were generated by deep sequencing in duplicate, using Illumina poly-A RNA seq.
(Submitter supplied) The goal of this study is to identify transcriptomic effects of RhoA G17V expression in mouse CD4+ T lymphocytes. To this end, mice conditionally expressing RhoA G17V were generated by replacing exon 3 of RhoA with a minigene containing RhoA exons 3 to 6 flanked by loxP sites followed by a neomycin selection cassette and a mutant Rhoa exon 3 encoding the G17V substitution. These mice were then crossed with the CD4CreERT2 line (Tg(Cd4-cre/ERT2)11Gnri, Jackson Laboratories), which expresses a 4-hydroxi-tamoxifen-inducible form of the Cre recombinase under the control of the mouse Cd4 promoter to generate conditional inducible CD4 specific RhoA G17V mice (Rhoaco-G17V/+ CD4CreERT2). more...

(Submitter supplied) Adenosine-to-Inosine (A-to-I) editing of dsRNA by ADAR proteins is a pervasive feature of the epitranscriptome. There are estimated to be over 100 million potential A-to-I editing sites in humans and A-to-I editing can have varying consequences for gene expression. Whilst editing resulting in protein recoding defines the role of ADAR2, ADAR1 has been proposed to have both editing-dependent and -independent functions. more...

However, this 'innate-like' function dissipates with age and is scarce in the adult. Here, we investigated the fate of CD4+CXCL8+ cells and their transition into conventional adaptive T cells. We show that CXCL8 is imprinted on immature thymocytes prior to TCR signalling and is maintained in T cell committed thymic progenitors and recent thymic emigrants (RTEs) of adults as well as neonates. more...

3510. Targeted reconstruction of T cell receptor sequence from single cell RNA-seq links CDR3 length to T cell differentiation state
(Submitter supplied) The T cell compartment must contain diversity in both T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire and cell state to provide effective immunity against pathogens. However, it remains unclear how differences in the TCR contribute to heterogeneity in T cell state. Single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) can allow simultaneous measurement of TCR sequence and global transcriptional profile from single cells. However, current methods for TCR inference from scRNA-seq are limited in their sensitivity and require long sequencing reads, thus increasing the cost and decreasing the number of cells that can be feasibly analyzed. more...

3520. Ten-Eleven Translocation 2 regulates adult neurogenesis through modulating 5mC oxidation dynamics at distinct regulatory elements
(Submitter supplied) Emerging evidence suggests that various epigenetic mechanisms play important roles in regulating adult neurogenesis. Ten-Eleven Translocation (Tet) proteins, the 5mC dioxygenases, could convert 5mC stepwise to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) and its further oxidation products, which constitute active DNA demethylation pathway. Here we show that unlike embryonic stem cells, 5hmC is acquired upon differentiation of adult neural stem cells (NSCs). more...

To define Core Regulatory Circuitries (CRCs) controlling the gene expression program of neuroblastoma, we established and analyzed the neuroblastoma super-enhancer landscape. We discovered three types of identity in neuroblastoma cell lines: a sympathetic noradrenergic identity defined by a CRC module including the PHOX2B, HAND2 and GATA3 transcription factors (TFs); an NCC-like identity, driven by a CRC module containing AP-1 family TFs; a mixed type further deconvoluted at the single cell level. more...

3546. Primate Primordial Germ Cells Acquire Transplantation Potential by Carnegie Stage 23
(Submitter supplied) Primordial germ cells (PGCs) are the earliest embryonic progenitors in the germline. Correct formation of PGCs is critical to reproductive health as an adult. Recent work has shown that primate PGCs can be differentiated from pluripotent stem cells; however, a bioassay that supports their identity as transplantable germ cells has not been reported. Here, we adopted a xenotransplantation assay by transplanting single-cell suspensions of human and nonhuman primate embryonic Macaca mulatta (rhesus macaque) testes containing PGCs into the seminiferous tubules of adult busulfan-treated nude mice. more...

(Submitter supplied) The preoptic area (POA) of the hypothalamus is known to be crucial for sleep generation, but the spatial intermingling of sleep- and wake-promoting neurons makes it difficult to dissect the sleep control circuit. Here we identified a population of POA sleep-promoting neurons based on their projection target. Using a lentivirus for retrograde labeling with channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) followed by optogenetic manipulation and recording, we found that the POA GABAergic neurons projecting to the tuberomammillary nucleus (TMN) are both sleep active and sleep promoting. more...

Progress has been made in deriving lung epithelial cells from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). However, little is known about the heterogeneity or genetic programs of the cells generated using these lung differentiation protocols. more...

(Submitter supplied) Organism: Mus musculus  Experiment type: Gene expression profiling by high throughput sequencing  Summary: Pathological angiogenesis is a hallmark of cancer and therapeutic target. Vascular-endothelial growth factor-A (VEGFA) and angiopoietin-2 (ANGPT2/ANG2) sustain tumor angiogenesis and limit anti-tumor immunity. We show that combined ANGPT2 and VEGFA blockade by mono-specific antibodies (LC06 + B20) or a bi-specific antibody (A2V) provides synergistic anti-tumoral benefits in both transgenic and transplant tumor models. more...

3577. Single cell gene expression in Dlxi1/2b::eGFP+ cells before and after migration, 2 weeks
(Submitter supplied) We report the expression of selected genes associated with cortical, striatal and olfactory interneurons in hSS-derived Dlxi1/2::eGFP cells before (in hSS) and after migration (in hCS). By fusing hiPSC-derived fusions that were separately patterned to generate either human subpallial spheroids (hSS) or human cortical spheroids (hCS) we are able to model human interneuron migration in vitro. The aim of this experiment is to examine the gene expression of hSS-derived Dlxi1/2::eGFP cells before and after migration.

(Submitter supplied) Adult tissue stem cells (SCs) reside in niches, which through intercellular contacts and signaling, influence SC behavior. Once activated, SCs typically give rise to short-lived transit-amplifying cells (TACs), which then progress to differentiate into their lineages. Here, using single cell RNA-sequencing, we unearth unexpected heterogeneity among SCs and TACs of hair follicles. We trace the roots of this heterogeneity to micro-niches along epithelial-mesenchymal interfaces, where progenitors display molecular signatures reflective of spatially distinct local signals and intercellular interactions. more...

3587. Cooperativity between EMT and non-EMT cells promotes breast cancer metastasis via paracrine GLI activation
(Submitter supplied) Recent fate mapping studies concluded that EMT is not required for metastasis of carcinomas. Here we challenge this conclusion by showing that it failed to account for possible crosstalk between EMT and non-EMT cells that promotes dissemination of non-EMT cells. In breast cancer models, EMT cells induce increased metastasis of weakly metastatic, non-EMT tumor cells in a paracrine manner in part by non-cell autonomous activation of the GLI transcription factor. more...

3641. ZSCAN5B and its primate-specific paralogs bind RNA polymerase III genes and extra-TFIIIC (ETC) sites to modulate mitotic progression [Mouse Placenta ChIP-Seq data set]
(Submitter supplied) Particularly in the context of differentiation and development, the importance of three-dimensional chromatin architecture to gene regulatory mechanisms is becoming increasingly clear.  The most ancient known mechanism of chromatin organization involves TFIIIC, a transcription factor (TF) that recruits RNA polymerase III (Pol III) for transcription of tRNA and other types of non-coding RNA genes. From yeast to mammals, TFIIIC binds to tRNA genes (tDNAs) and scattered “extra-TFIIIC” (ETC) loci and serves to tether these loci together as anchors of chromatin loops. more...

3642. Converting adult pancreatic α-cells into β-cells by targeting Dnmt1 and Arx
(Submitter supplied) After their destruction in adult mice, insulin-producing pancreatic beta-cells slowly regenerate from other islet cells, like glucagon-producing alpha-cells. However the molecular basis of this conversion is unknown. Moreover it remains unclear if this intra-islet cell conversion is relevant to human diseases with extensive beta-cell loss, like in type 1 diabetes (T1D). Here, we show that subsets of glucagon-expressing cells in subjects with T1D produce Insulin and other molecular features of beta-cells, accompanied by loss of the alpha-cell regulators DNA methyltransferase 1 (Dnmt1) and Aristaless-related homeobox (Arx). more...

3674. TGF-β inhibitors stimulate red blood cell production by enhancing self-renewal of BFU-E erythroid progenitors
(Submitter supplied) Erythroid progenitor BFU-Es are so-named based on their ability to generate in methylcellulose culture large colonies of erythroid cells that consist of “bursts” of smaller erythroid colonies derived from the later CFU-E Epo- dependent progenitors. “Early” BFU-E cells forming large BFU-E colonies presumably have higher capacities for self-renewal than do those forming small BFU-E colonies. In order to understand the mechanism underlying this heterogeneity, we conducted single cell transcriptome analysis on BFU-E cells purified from mouse embryos. more...

3708. Single-cell spatial reconstruction reveals global division of labor in the mammalian liver
(Submitter supplied) The mammalian liver consists of hexagonal-shaped lobules, radially polarized by blood flow and morphogens. Key liver genes have been shown to be differentially expressed along the lobule axis, a phenomenon termed zonation, but a detailed genome-wide reconstruction of this spatial division of labor has not been achieved. Here we measure the whole transcriptome of thousands of single mouse liver cells and infer their lobule coordinates using a panel of zonated landmark genes, characterized with single-molecule FISH. more...

3710. p53 is a critical regulator of airway epithelial progenitor cell homeostasis.
(Submitter supplied) How progenitor cells regulate quiescence and differentiation is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that the tumor suppressor p53 regulates both proliferation and differentiation of club progenitor cells in the airway epithelium. We show that p53 loss decreases ciliated cell differentiation and increases the proliferative capacity of club progenitors, increasing epithelial cell density. p53 deficient progenitors generated a pseudostratified epithelium containing basal-like cells in vitro and contained an increased proportion of BASCs in vivo, suggesting that p53 suppresses multipotency during homeostasis. more...

(Submitter supplied) Gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) has been suggested to be involved in early embryonic development but the actual functional role remained elusive. Connexin (Cx) 43 and Cx45 are co-expressed in embryonic stem (ES) cells, form gap junctions and are considered to exhibit adhesive function and/or to contribute to the establishment of defined communication compartments. Here we describe the generation of Cx43/Cx45-double deficient mouse ES cells to achieve almost complete breakdown of GJIC. more...

(Submitter supplied) Cancer metastasis requires that primary tumour cells evolve the capacity to intravasate into the lymphatic system or vasculature, and extravasate into and colonize secondary sites1. Others have demonstrated that individual cells within complex populations show heterogeneity in their capacity to form secondary lesions2   5. Here we develop a polyclonal mouse model of breast tumour heterogeneity, and show that distinct clones within a mixed population display specialization, for example, dominating the primary tumour, contributing to metastatic populations, or showing tropism for entering the lymphatic or vasculature systems. more...

(Submitter supplied) Recent efforts have uncovered immense transcriptional and ontogenetic diversity among tissue-resident macrophages, each with their own transcriptional profile endowing the cell with its tissue-specific functions. However, it is currently unknown whether the origins of different macrophage populations may affect their roles in malignancy. Given potential artifacts associated with irradiation-based lineage tracing, it remains unclear if bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) are even present in tumors of the brain, a tissue where there is no homeostatic involvement of peripherally-derived myeloid cells. more...

(Submitter supplied) Microtubule actin crosslinking factor 1 (Macf1) plays a role in coordinated actions of actin and microtubules in multiple cellular processes. Here we show that Macf1 is also critical for ciliogenesis in multiple cell types. Ablation of Macf1 in the developing retina abolishes ciliogenesis and basal bodies fail to dock to ciliary vesicles or migrate apically. Photoreceptor polarity is randomized while inner retinal cells laminate correctly, suggesting that photoreceptor maturation is guided by polarity cues provided by cilia. more...

We found that the inactive X-chromosome (Xi) of primed hESCs was reactivated in naïve culture conditions. Similar to cells of the blastocyst, resulting naive cells exhibited two active X-chromosomes with XIST expression and chromosome-wide transcriptional dampening, and initiated XIST-mediated X-inactivation upon differentiation. more...

3742. The germ cell fate of cynomolgus monkeys is specified in the amnion
(Submitter supplied) The germ cell lineage ensures reproduction, heredity and evolution. However, the mechanism for germ cell specification in primates, including humans, has been unknown. In primates, the pluripotent epiblast segregates the amnion upon implantation and thereafter initiates gastrulation to generate three germ layers. Here, we show that in cynomolgus monkeys, the SOX17/BLIMP1/TFAP2C-positive primordial germ cells (cyPGCs) arise from the dorsal amnion at embryonic day (E) 11. more...

3773. A distinct gene module uncouples dysfunction from activation in tumor-infiltrating T cells (batch 1)
(Submitter supplied) Reversing the dysfunctional T cell state that arises in cancer and chronic viral infections is the focus of therapeutic interventions; however, current therapies are effective in only some patients and some tumor types. To gain a deeper molecular understanding of the dysfunctional T cell state, we analyzed population and single-cell RNA profiles of CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and used genetic perturbations to identify a distinct gene module for T cell dysfunction that can be uncoupled from T cell activation. more...

3784. Single cell transcriptome analysis of mouse thoracic sympathetic ganglia
(Submitter supplied) We explore the heterogeneity of mouse thoracic ganglia demonstrating the presence of an unexpected variety of cell-types and identify specialized populations of nipple- and pilo-erector muscle neurons. These neurons extend axonal projections and are born amongst other neurons during embryogenesis, but remain unspecialized until target organogenesis occurs postnatally. Target innervation and cell-type specification is coordinated by an intricate acquisition of unique combinations of growth factor receptors and the initiation of expression of concomitant ligands by the nascent erector muscles.

(Submitter supplied) A prevalent hypothesis for the cell-to-cell coordination of the phenomena of early development is that a defined mixture of different mRNA species at specific abundances in each cell determines fate and behavior. With this dataset we explore this hypothesis by quantifying the abundance of every mRNA species in every individual cell of the early C. elegans embryo, for which the exact life history and fate is precisely documented.

3810. Selective single cell isolation for genomics using microraft arrays
(Submitter supplied) Genomic methods are used increasingly to interrogate the individual cells that compose specific tissues. However, current methods for single cell isolation struggle to phenotypically differentiate specific cells in a heterogeneous population and rely primarily on the use of fluorescent markers. Many cellular phenotypes of interest are too complex to be measured by this approach, making it difficult to connect genotype and phenotype at the level of individual cells. more...

3811. In vitro cultured H7 human embryonic stem cells (WiCell) and H7-derived downstream early mesoderm progenitors
(Submitter supplied) Stem-cell differentiation to desired lineages requires navigating alternating developmental paths that often lead to unwanted cell types. Hence, comprehensive developmental roadmaps are crucial to channel stem-cell differentiation toward desired fates. To this end, here, we map bifurcating lineage choices leading from pluripotency to 12 human mesodermal lineages, including bone, muscle, and heart. We defined the extrinsic signals controlling each binary lineage decision, enabling us to logically block differentiation toward unwanted fates and rapidly steer pluripotent stem cells toward 80%–99% pure human mesodermal lineages at most branchpoints. more...

(Submitter supplied) RNA editing is a mutational mechanism that specifically alters the nucleotide content in sets of transcripts while leaving their cognate genomic blueprint intact. Editing has been detected from bulk RNA-seq data in thousands of distinct transcripts, but apparent editing rates can vary widely (from under 1% to almost 100%). These observed editing rates could result from approximately equal rates of editing within each individual cell in the bulk sample, or alternatively, editing estimates from a population of cells could reflect an average of distinct, biologically significant editing signatures that vary substantially between individual cells in the population. more...

(Submitter supplied) In mammals, extensive chromatin reorganization is essential for reprogramming terminally committed gametes to a totipotent state during preimplantation development. However, the global chromatin landscape and its dynamics in this period remain unexplored. Here we report a genome-wide map of accessible chromatin in mouse preimplantation embryos using an improved assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with high throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq) approach with CRISPR/Cas9-assisted mitochondrial DNA depletion. more...

3842. Systematic reconstruction of molecular cascades regulating growth plate development using single-cell RNA-seq
(Submitter supplied) The growth plate, which comprises sequentially differentiated cell layers, is a critical structure for bone elongation and regeneration. Although several key regulators in growth plate development have been identified using primarily genetic perturbation, the systematic understanding is still limited. Here we used single cell RNA-seq to interrogate gene expression profiles of 217 single cells from growth plates, and developed the bioinfromatics pipeline Sinova to de-novo reconstruct physiological growth plate development in both temporal and spatial high-resolution. more...

3843. Dissecting the direct reprogramming path of fibroblasts into neurons by single cell RNA-sequencing
(Submitter supplied) Direct lineage reprogramming represents a remarkable conversion of cellular and transcriptome states. However, the intermediates through which individual cells progress are largely undefined. Here we used single cell RNA-seq at multiple time points to dissect direct reprogramming from mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) to induced neuronal (iN) cells. By deconstructing heterogeneity at each time point and ordering cells by transcriptome similarity rather than time we reconstructed a continuous reprogramming path. more...

3856. Single Cell Sequencing Identifies Key Epigenetic Regulators in Nuclear Transfer Mediated Reprogramming [RNA-seq]
(Submitter supplied) Differentiated cell can be reprogrammed into totipotent embryo through somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT). However, this process is highly inefficient and most cloned embryos arrest at certain developmental stages. Through single cell sequencing combined with embryo biopsy, here we generate a global map of DNA methylome and RNA transcriptome for SCNT embryos with distinct developmental fates. We subsequently demonstrate that the unfaithful reactivation of two histone demethylases, Kdm4b and Kdm5b, accounts for the arrest of cloned embryos at 2-cell and 4-cell stage, respectively. more...

(Submitter supplied) The process of neural tube closure is a highly complex morphogenetic event that results in the generation of the primordial central nervous system. During formation of the neural tube, the non-neural ectoderm separates from the neighboring neural ectoderm and forms a single layer epithelial sheet that overlies the closed neural tube. Previous work has shown that the non-neural ectoderm is necessary for proper cranial neural tube closure, however little is known about this cell population at the molecular level or how the non-neural ectoderm contributes to neural tube closure. more...

3875. Two mutually exclusive local chromatin states drive efficient V(D)J recombination
(Submitter supplied) V(D)J recombination is the first determinant of antigen receptor diversity. Understanding how recombination is regulated requires a comprehensive, unbiased readout of V gene usage. We have developed VDJ-seq, a DNA-based next-generation- sequencing technique that quantitatively profiles recombination products. We reveal a 200-fold range of recombination efficiency among recombining V genes in the primary mouse Igh repertoire. more...

3877. Single-muscle-cell transcriptome profiling along the planarian anteroposterior axis
(Submitter supplied) How positional information instructs adult tissue maintenance is poorly understood. Planarians undergo whole-body regeneration and tissue turnover, providing a model for adult positional information studies. Genes encoding secreted and transmembrane components of multiple developmental pathways are predominantly expressed in planarian muscle cells. Several of these genes regulate regional identity, consistent with muscle harboring positional information. more...

3878. In silico lineage tracing through single cell transcriptomes identifies a neural stem cell population in planarians
(Submitter supplied) Background: The planarian, Schmidtea mediterranea, is a master regenerator with a large adult stem cell compartment. The lack of transgenic labeling techniques in this animal have hindered the study of lineage progression and has made understanding the mechanisms of tissue replacement during regeneration a challenge. However, recent advances in single cell transcriptomics and analysis methods may allow for the discovery of novel cell lineages as differentiation progresses from stem cell to terminally differentiated cell. more...

3881. Enhanced CLIP uncovers IMP protein-RNA targets in human pluripotent stem cells important for cell adhesion and survival [RNA-Seq]
(Submitter supplied) Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) require precise control of post-transcriptional RNA networks to maintain proliferation and survival. Using a recently developed enhanced UV crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (eCLIP) approach, we identify RNA targets of the IMP/IGF2BP family of RNA-binding proteins in hPSCs. At the broad region- and binding site-level IMP1 and IMP2 show reproducible binding to a large and overlapping set of 3'UTR-enriched targets. more...

3883. Distinct myeloid progenitor differentiation pathways uncovered through single cell RNA sequencing
(Submitter supplied) Haematopoietic stem cells can differentiate into all blood cell types. In this process, cells become progressively restricted to a single cell type. The order in which differentiating cells loose lineage potential, and the prospective isolation of cells with a defined potential remains a long-standing question.    We performed gene expression analysis of haematopoietic cells from Gata1-EGFP reporter mice, leading to a model for hematopoiesis where the initial lineage decision consists of a seperation of erythroid/megakaryocyte/mast cell/eosinophil potential from lymphopoietic/monocyte/neutrophil potential

(Submitter supplied) To glean an appreciation of the holistic genetic activity in the gastrulating mouse embryo, we performed a genome-wide spatial transcriptome analysis (Stereo-seq), using a low-cell number sequencing protocol on laser microdissected samples of epiblast cells with retained positional address. The 3D transcriptome reveals that (i) the epiblast is partitioned into transcription domains corresponding to regions of epiblast where cells are endowed specifically with ectoderm and mesendoderm potency, (ii) novel lineage markers are identified as genes expressed in epiblast domains populated by cells displaying different lineage fates, (iii) functionally related gene regulatory circuitry and signaling pathways are acting in concert in the transcriptional domains, and (iv) the spatial information provides reference zipcodes for mapping the prospective address of cell samples from different embryos and stem cell lines. more...

(Submitter supplied) Fusion of donor mesenchymal stem cells with parenchymal cells of the recipient can occur in the brain, liver, intestine and heart following transplantation.  The therapeutic benefit or detriment of resultant hybrids is unknown.  Here we sought a global view of phenotypic diversification of mesenchymal stem cell-cardiomyocyte hybrids and associated time course. Using single-cell RNA-seq, we found hybrids consistently increase ribosome components and decrease genes associated with the cell cycle suggesting an increase in protein production and decrease in proliferation to accommodate the fused state. more...

In mice, deficiency of miR-146a results in hematolymphoid cancer at advanced ages as a consequence of constitutive NF-κB activity.  In this study, we queried whether the deficiency of miR-146a contributes to B-cell oncogenesis. Combining miR-146a deficiency with transgenic expression of c-Myc led to the development of highly aggressive B-cell malignancies. more...

4001. Single cell transcriptome analysis of mouse carotid body glomus cells
(Submitter supplied) The carotid body (CB) is a major arterial chemoreceptor containing glomus cells whose activities are regulated by changes in arterial blood contents including oxygen. We employed the single cell RNA­Seq method by performing next-generation sequencing on single glomus cell­derived cDNAs to eliminate contamination of genes derived from other cell types present in the CB. This study has generated a CB expression profile containing novel glomus cell specific genes. more...

(Submitter supplied) In this study we studied the presence of tumor cells that underwent epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition within polyoma middle T antigen (PyMT) breast tumors. For this we dissociated tumors and isolated Ecad positive tumor cells by FACS sorting. We confirmed that PyMT tumors contain a small set of tumor cells that have undergone EMT in the primary tumor and that E-cadherin can be used as a marker on single cell level for mesenchymal status in this model.

(Submitter supplied) Single cell genome, DNA methylome, and transcriptome sequencing has been achieved separately. However, to analyze the regulation of RNA expression by genetic and epigenetic factors within an individual cell, it is necessary to analyze these omics simultaneously from the same single cell. Here we developed a single cell triple omics sequencing technique- scTrio-seq, to analyze the genome, DNA methylome, and transcriptome concurrently of a mammalian cell.

4008. Loss of CSL unlocks a hypoxic response and enhanced tumor growth potential in breast cancer cells
(Submitter supplied) Notch signaling is an important regulator of stem cell differentiation. All canonical Notch signaling is transmitted through the DNA-binding protein CSL and hyperactivated Notch signaling is associated with tumor development; thus it may be anticipated that CSL deficiency should reduce tumor growth. In contrast, we report that genetic removal of CSL in breast tumor cells caused accelerated growth of xenografted tumors. more...

4014. Characterizing transcriptional heterogeneity through pathway and gene set overdispersion analysis (PAGODA)
(Submitter supplied) The extent of transcriptional diversity in mouse NPCs is likely to be influenced by a variety of unexamined factors that include programmed cell death, genomic mosaicism as well as a variety of “environmental” influences such as changes in exposure to signaling lipids. We therefore used scRNA-seq to assess a cohort of cortical NPCs from an embryonic mouse. We demonstrate that PAGODA (Pathway And Geneset OverDispersion Analysis) effectively recovers the known neuroanatomical and functional organization of NPCs, identifying multiple aspects of transcriptional heterogeneity within the developing mouse cortex that are difficult to discern by the existing heterogeneity analysis approaches.

4015. Transcriptomic Analysis of Petunia hybrida in Response to Salt Stress Using High Throughput RNA Sequencing
(Submitter supplied) Salinity and drought stress are the primary cause of crop losses worldwide. In sodic saline soils sodium chloride (NaCl) disrupts normal plant growth and development. The complex interactions of plant systems with abiotic stress have made RNA sequencing a more holistic and appealing approach to study transcriptome level responses in a single cell and/or tissue. In this work, we determined the Petunia transcriptome response to NaCl stress by sequencing leaf samples and assembling 196 million Illumina reads with Trinity software. more...

(Submitter supplied) CTCF and BORIS (CTCFL), two paralogous mammalian proteins sharing nearly identical DNA binding domains, are thought to function in mutually exclusive manners in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. Here we show that these two proteins co-occupy a specific subset of regulatory elements consisting of clustered CTCF binding motifs (termed 2xCTSes). BORIS occupancy at 2xCTSes is largely invariant in BORIS-positive cancer cells, with the genomic pattern recapitulating the germline-specific BORIS binding to chromatin. more...

(Submitter supplied) Tbx3, a member of the T-box family, plays important roles in development, stem cells, nuclear reprogramming and cancer. Loss of Tbx3 induces differentiation in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). However, we show that mESCs exist in an alternate stable pluripotent state in the absence of Tbx3.

4078. Generation of Cynomolgus Monkey Chimeric Fetuses Using Embryonic Stem cells
(Submitter supplied) Because of their similarity to humans, non-human primates are important models for studying human disease and developing therapeutic strategies.  Establishment of chimeric animals using embryonic stem cells (ESCs) could help with these investigations, but has not so far been achieved. Here, we show that cynomolgus monkey ESCs (cESCs) grown in adjusted culture conditions are able to incorporate into host embryos and develop into chimeras with contribution in all three germ layers and in germ cell progenitors. more...

Here we exploit the X-chromosome-wide process of dosage compensation to dissect these mechanisms. The dosage compensation complex (DCC) of C. elegans, a condensin complex, binds to both X chromosomes of hermaphrodites via sequence-specific recruitment sites (rex sites) to reduce chromosome-wide gene expression by half. more...

4093. Molecular signatures of heterogeneous stem cell populations are resolved by linking single cell functional assays to single cell gene expression
(Submitter supplied) The discovery of significant heterogeneity in the self-renewal durability of adult haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) has challenged our understanding of the molecules involved in population maintenance throughout life.  Gene expression studies in bulk populations are difficult to interpret since multiple HSC subtypes are present and HSC purity is typically less than 50% of the input cell population.  Numerous groups have therefore turned to studying gene expression profiles of single HSCs, but again these studies are limited by the purity of the input fraction and an inability to directly ascribe a molecular program to a durable self-renewing HSC.  Here we combine single cell functional assays with flow cytometric index sorting and single cell gene expression assays to gain the first insight into the gene expression program of HSCs that possess durable self-renewal.  This approach can be used in other stem cell systems and sets the stage for linking key molecules with defined cellular functions.

(Submitter supplied) Super-enhancers (SEs) are large clusters of transcriptional enhancers that are co-occupied by multiple lineage specific transcription factors driving expression of genes that define cell identity. In embryonic stem cells (ESCs), SEs are highly enriched for Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog in the enhanceosome assembly and express enhancer RNAs (eRNAs). We sought to dissect the molecular control mechanism of SE activity and eRNA transcription for pluripotency and reprogramming. more...

4112. Spatial reconstruction of single-cell gene expression
(Submitter supplied) Spatial localization is a key determinant of cellular fate and behavior, but spatial RNA assays traditionally rely on staining for a limited number of RNA species. In contrast, single-cell RNA-seq allows for deep profiling of cellular gene expression, but established methods separate cells from their native spatial context. Here we present Seurat, a computational strategy to infer cellular localization by integrating single-cell RNA-seq data with in situ RNA patterns. more...

4118. Single Cell Analysis Reveals Unexpected Transcriptional Heterogeneity of Neural Progenitors in the Developing Human Cortex
(Submitter supplied) The human cerebral cortex depends for its normal development and size on a precisely controlled balance between self-renewal and differentiation of diverse neural progenitor cells. Specialized progenitors that are common in humans, but virtually absent in rodents, called ‘outer radial glia’ (ORG), have been suggested to be crucial to the evolutionary expansion of the human cortex. We combined cell type-specific sorting with transcriptome-wide RNA-sequencing to identify genes enriched in human ORG, including targets of the transcription factor Neurogenin, and previously uncharacterized, evolutionarily dynamic, long noncoding RNAs. more...

4138. Deconstructing the dynamic transcriptional program of pluripotent stem cells.
(Submitter supplied) Pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) are capable of dynamic interconversion between distinct substates, but the regulatory circuits specifying these states and enabling transitions between them are not well understood. We set out to address this issue and map the landscape of gene expression variability in PSCs by single-cell expression profiling of PSCs under different chemical and genetic perturbations. We find that signaling factors and developmental regulators show highly variable expression in PSCs, with expression states for some variable genes heritable through multiple cell divisions. Expression variability and population heterogeneity can be influenced by perturbation of signaling pathways and chromatin regulators. Strikingly, either removal of mature miRNAs or pharmacologic blockage of external signaling pathways drives PSCs into a low-noise ground state characterized by a reconfigured pluripotency regulatory network, increased self-renewal efficiency, and a distinct chromatin state, an effect mediated by the action of opposing miRNA families on the c-myc / Lin28 / let-7 axis. These findings illuminate the causes of transcriptional heterogeneity in PSCs and their consequences for cellular decision-making.

4143. Endogenous miRNA and target concentrations determine susceptibility to potential ceRNA competition, based on hierarchical binding affinities (mRNA)
(Submitter supplied) Target competition (ceRNA crosstalk) within miRNA-regulated gene networks has been proposed to influence biological systems. To assess target competition, we characterize and quantitate miRNA networks in two cell types. Argonaute iCLIP reveals that hierarchical binding of high to low affinity miRNA targets is a key characteristic of in vivo activity. Quantification of cellular miRNA and mRNA/ncRNA target pool levels indicates that miRNA-Target pool ratios and an affinity partitioned target pool accurately predict in vivo Ago binding profiles and miRNA susceptibility to target competition. more...

4176. Genome-wide identification of regulatory elements in preSertoli cells based on DNaseI hypersensitivity
(Submitter supplied) Identifying transcriptional networks active during development has been hindered by the slow pace at which regulatory elements are identified, and by the difficulty in purifying cells from developing tissues. We used DNaseI-seq to identify functional regulatory elements in purified fetal preSertoli cells and uncovered thousands of preSertoli-specific DNaseI hypersensitive sites (DHSs) that are likely to activate or repress genes required for Sertoli cell development and function. more...

4177. Single Cell RNA-Seq
(Submitter supplied) RNA-seq transcriptome measurements are typically performed by isolating RNA from large numbers of cells in culture or tissues. While highly informative, such experiments mask the variability in gene expression patterns that exists between individual cells. To gain insight into the dynamics of gene expression on the level of single-cells, we have carried out the transcriptomes of single-cells from the GM12878 cell line using RNA-seq.

4179. Subcellular RNA Sequencing Reveals Broad Presence of Cytoplasmic Intron-sequence Retaining Transcripts in Mouse and Rat Neurons.
(Submitter supplied) Recent findings have revealed the complexity of the transcriptional landscape in mammalian cells. One recently described class of novel transcripts are the Cytoplasmic Intron-sequence Retaining Transcripts (CIRTs), hypothesized to confer post-transcriptional regulatory function. For instance, the neuronal CIRT KCNMA1i16 contributes to the firing properties of hippocampal neurons. We hypothesized that CIRTs may be present in a broad set of transcripts and comprise novel signals for post-transcriptional regulation. more...

4209. Global Deterministic and Stochastic Allelic Specific Gene Expression in Single Blastomeres of Mouse Early Embryos
(Submitter supplied) Here we modified a single cell whole transcriptome amplification method to make it capable of amplifying cDNAs as long as 3kb efficiently and unbiasedly. We combined this modified single cell cDNA amplification method with Applied Biosystems next generation sequencing SOLiD™ System to set up a single cell whole transcriptome assay.  The modified amplification strategy allows us to amplify full-length cDNAs for most of the expressed genes. more...

4210. Characterization of the single-cell transcriptional landscape by highly multiplex RNA-Seq
(Submitter supplied) Our understanding of the development and maintenance of tissues has been greatly aided by large-scale gene expression analysis. However, tissues are invariably complex, and expression analysis of a tissue confounds the true expression patterns of its constitutent cell types. Here we propose a novel strategy to access such complex samples. Hundreds of single-cell RNA-Seq expression profiles were generated, and clustered to form a two-dimensional cell map onto which expression data was projected. more...
